519,"Ya bro I'm the same fucking way, after you endure so much mental pain sitting at a large loss, you can't wait to offload that turd. Problem is most likely the underlying is finally fucking working like you initially planned, but you're too jaded and scared to stick to your plan. This is such a touch thing to overcome dude. 

Of course rolling your position out once you're positive isn't a bad strategy, but October is still pretty far out so just sit tight man. Don't doubt your vibe, and don't listen to the noise here. That includes me dude lmao. Good luck man, we both need a little here."

521,"Diamond hand bro 

im in my boxers at 1pm so take that with a grain of salt."
522,Yeah when people say leaps they‚Äôre referring to long dated calls or puts. So like if you think pton is going to 200 just for conversation sake you would go buy a expiration for a 2022 call for pton for like $90 or whatever and if it even was 150 $ 6 months from now you‚Äôd be swimming in profit.
523,A body got any good eod plays ?
524,just buy calls eod then when they will be cheaper. IV droping like a fuckin rock today too.

I got a plan, 6 of us move to NY figure out whose who as in whose pushing the buttons and making shit move. We influence them subliminally.

example

During PRPL people could have followed around Jamie Dimon and stuck purple shit int he surroundings and just be around him on the phone talking about mattresses and renting vans painting them like PRPL brand etc, maybe even a fender bender where a fake delivery driver informs him its his fault from fatigue from all the new business and how they have everyone working a tight shift to maximize profits etc.

&amp;#x200B;

whose down? atm the mission would be Silver, my suggestion is we have one of those shitty meme rappers have a new song whining mumbling about how he cant afford a platinum chain for his female but he loves buying her Silver

Babe uhhhhh yeah babe uhhhh yeah for a minute you were going to get the platinum

babe uhh  yeahh but the benjamins aint there I got 4 jacksons

835,Yes puts and uvxy calls
836,"That is typically what happens. The lower price brings in more buyers and there is a bump for a few days before everybody comes to their senses. 

I think this will happen with aapl because it has been pinned all week.

I think tsla is going to tank immediately because all the trading up to this point has been meme based. There is no motivation for it to go above 420.69, and once everyone sees it there and gets their chuckle, it will dump."

838,"When you say max downside, do you mean max downside of the spread? That's not what happens if apple closes at 499. The holder of your short 500 put would exercise them and you would not be able to exercise your 497 long put because it's out the money. You would have to buy hundreds of shares of apple at 500, with cash. That's why rh closes spreads."

841,"Not confident in an announcement over the weekend on tik tok with the price action on Msft today.

Insiders should be loading up instead of selling. That mid day dip is scary. All it takes is for them to announce it mid week and the fizzle would die with the stop loss triggering."
842,EOD? there has been a rotation out of tsla since open.
843,*tim aapl has entered the chat*
844,Is amzn really gonna stay flat all day??

Not saying fomo is, but 100% bets only is insane. Even buffet doubted himself enough on his come up to pick 2-3 at once ( and hold cash)"

Been steadily getting 1k per week min using credit spreads expiring weekly, been pretty safe if they are out of the money by a lot and has enough volume.

Chose put spreads bc I dont have to worry about theta decay as much and benefit if it stays flat or goes up, but with election coming along, maybe straddles are the move?"

897,"weak hands and institutional investors like buffet selling aapl rn

hang tight split squad, gonna be ok"
898,Go home aapl you're drunk.
899,My guess is there will be alot of Tesla buying on Monday. Alot of people sold covered calls and were not able to buy back their calls and thus were stuck in their positions. Their calls should expire now and they can get their profits and buy back some shares.
900,You think aapl will print 550c 9/4?

Honestly lost like 1k yesterday  and 400 today holding when I should have sold in the morning.  Got in PTON late today, got in ZM early. My timing is never perfect.  Expecting to make more with PTON in the next week or two.Thinking ZM gaps up Monday"
943,apple is going to stop being fucking gay and my qqq 9/11s are going to print like their got damn life depends on it. because they do. i want to come home.
944,I said that.  Accomplished it. Then tried conservative... it was boring af.  Opened a half dozen calls eod for a spicier week next week.
945,"I need to start doing something smart... like itm long dated calls on reliable value stocks with trailing stops. Just buy it and never look at it again until the day of expiration.

I keep gambling on lottery tickets and passing on $1500 gains holding out to see how high it will go just to end up negative."

947,"After the run up tsla and aapl had expect institutional investors to trim their positions made easy by the forward splits, happens every time"
948,"Personally I use some margin, but don‚Äôt now that it has run up so much. If it goes down, I use margin to buy more. I do Roku because I think they are worth at least 200/share and the company has a great long term trajectory, so I don‚Äôt mind holding in the off case the share price goes down. The premiums are fat too and usually stay that way. I never sell a cc below my cost basis though, which means sometimes I get a little less. 

It also pops sometimes like crazy. I got lucky this past week and timed it great to switch to buy some calls and decided not to sell any cc. Made about ten grand. Would have been pissed if I was selling a cc when it went up that much though. My guess is it‚Äôll trade sideways until earnings after the run up this past week, maybe it will hit 180 which is where the average analyst has their price target at. I will probs switch back to cc only next week once it looks like share price has stabilized a bit or that the 175 level is holding."
949,And those couple lucky bastards who yolo fomo and make 100k
950,"They stopped curating their sellers by allowing tons of alibaba resellers who make super minor changes or just straight up resell cheap china shit. Their fees went up from .20 a listing to now about 8.5% of each sale at a minimum, including fees on the shipping price you charge customers. 

They made changes to their ads system which gave shop owners much less control over ad performance and spend - took away the option to prioritize ad spend on a set of particular items. Then when shops responded by spending less on ads, Etsy implemented a forced system of ad-spend where the shop owner has no ability to opt out, but will get charged an additional 15% in fees if the sale comes in from those ads.

Essentially, the things that made Etsy popular (hand-crafted goods by passionate people running small shops with the chance to get bigger) have been pushed aside in favor of Amazon customers who just want the cheapest prices and quickest service, and shops that can move the most volume so that Etsy can make the most on their fees.

I bet you think this sounds bullish as Etsy rakes in way more off the transactions it's platform handles, but in that process they are slowly strangling the thing that made it special in the first place."
951,"You know I love you, too, my bro :)
You are priceless."
952,they all yolo again to get to a mil and lose it all. one thing I have learned in here: yolo is not a policy
953,Sorry bro we rotated to PTON and CHWY today
954,MM got fucked! Aapl was at 500 right at 5:30. Over 100k of open interest for aapl 500c strikes
955,I heard ppl saying about huge volume open interest for 500c strike price. Not sure how to interpret that
956,"Fair enough, but I (the US) has history on it's side so far.  Of course, the past is no prediction of the future......  #Back2BackWorldWarChamps.    Seriously though, I spent a very long time concerned about the US debt and inflation until I talked to an ""outspoken"" professor who told me.... ""Son, the world currency is the US dollar.  We control interest and we control inflation.  The only equalizer is war..... And we control that as well.  Always invest in the US stock market, it can't go tits up unless we end up saluting a different flag"". Ok, I made that last part up, but the reasoning is sound.  Buy aapl and tsla, not because they are the best......but because they are American."
957,"Nice, I was actually going to buy an AAPL or MSFT call today, but I can only afford &lt; 1 month exp so I decided just buy SNE and TWTR December calls."
958,Crazy to think that‚Äôs how it is with -32% gdp and 10% unemployment. No where to put the money so whatcha going to do!
959,Yessir. Caught WMT on the way up. And sold most my other positions around the top. AAPL bs eod hurt but I holding my spread over the weekend anyway. Hbu? Spy had a nice rally up
