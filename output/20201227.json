To me it's like asking if I'd go back in time and invest in AMZN in 1999 prior to the bubble, of course I would because it's going to go up after everything settles.

            "Sure. The reason to buy in a single word is value.  You mentioned 11 months, for example. So I will use your own example. What do you think you can return on your own with PSTH in 11 months? Buffet does 20% a year. Chamath got a few hundred % this year with multiple spacs. What can you do? Lets say you're really really good. You can do 40% in the next 11 months considering how tightened up the market is since March.   The value of PSTH, to answer your question, since this is a Q and A, is that once you consume enough info on all aspects of the play (the capped downside, the CEO, the climate, the spac size, the incentive, the S1, the investor list, the pool of targets), you quickly realize that this is a 200% stock in 12 months at minimum. That's at minimum, not counting your personal tontine warrants.  Anyone who's managing a port for themselves or their family is being negligent if they don't at least have a minority stake in this stock imo (as a hedge against your own successes or failures).",

Digital is not going to take over - there are tons of people myself included that prefer physical disks over downloads. With a disc I own the game outright, I can loan it to friends or trade them for a game they may have that I want to play... If I want to play a game at a friend's house I just take the game with me no reason to bring the whole goddamn console.  Top all of this off with the fact that they have  closed their bloated infrastructure to a more lean and financially efficient brick and mortar Network they will be turning a profit in the next quarter....

I'm not trying to be associated with dumbasses like you and OverpricedButthole.   Ever since the retarded \"short squeeze\" bullshit, GMEtards have just been insufferable pricks. And regulars in this subreddit can tell from the aggressive shit talking and ghetto lexicon, (and the fact that they have been outed), that there is an outsider crew at the center of this.   So yeah, ill buy more calls when GME crashes again to take advantage of the momentum stupidity can create, but for both my beliefs about their future and the negativity of the GME crew, I'm not making any big plays with them.

Perhaps distribution networks will catch up in the coming years so you can store your game in the cloud and pull it when you need it ( stadia ).  Also, gamestop lets you reserve the game months out with $5, so you can essentially put it on layaway and get the copy day one, the second its released.    There is also a limit on how many consoles a retailer can get in stock, so while all the online only retailers are sold out, gamestop has direct distribution to the end users.  They can also act as a service portal ( if positioned right ).  Gamestop also offers exclusive content with new games as another way to get people to buy from them.   Finally, i buy all the games i want to play used, from them, i imagine there are many more people doing it as well since not everyone needs play them day one nor wants to pay full price( which is more of a protest over the $70-80 price for me since they sell millions of copies ).     Its not all roses, but with a transition to a technology company, you could see things really take off for them.  At a minimum, console season/year is a win for them which means a win for the stock(usually).",

Bluntly speaking, I don\u2019t know your age, risk parameters or what you do and I don\u2019t care. But know this, as a 1099 employee prepare to give a ton of your stated income to the IRS. Also, while you can have both a SEP and an Individual 401k there is no reason to! You only get the tax benefit from one. You may have a very questionable CPA. Also, while tax deferral is great, it is only recognized when you pull the money out, and either it\u2019s a 10% prepay, if under 59 1/2, plus added income tax or just added income tax. Either way, you will pay extra in taxes when you pull the money out unless it\u2019s in a ROTH and there may be some hiccups with that in the future. Have no illusions!! Yes, tax deferral is nice and I truly believe in having many multiple different accounts for different purposes, but I don\u2019t think you really understand this.   Also, you cannot really trade spec. options inside of IRAs. Only protective options. Most people on WSB want to shoot for the moon or make spec trades quickly. I\u2019m glad you admit to your luck and lack of trading knowledge. At least we agree on that.   Your long winded post is just full of fluff. A lot of hot air with no good advice. So many of us here have 7 figure + accounts, but we don\u2019t offer crappy investment advice along with coming across like an ass.  Saying you would be happy making 25-30% a year while also admitting to not really being a good investor, never using options and mostly being lucky is so funny!! Even the most astute intelligent investors hope for a 8-10% yearly return. You sir are a pure clown!   Lastly, please let me know where you play poker, you sound like a tight nit! Lol.

            "Its very hard to predict the timeline to a return to those levels. There are a lot of factors at play that are just hard to predict. The company is certainly undervalued at present though. And the rise in online stuff and its being well-positioned is a good thing. The fact it will only increase its Canadian standing is also a good thing. There is also some uncertainty as to whether the cineworld pullout is actually legal, in my understanding.   Someone commented that it was to do with the company's longstanding debt. That's untrue, it was to do with a pandemic that made such a purpose by another movie company (suffering similarly) obviously less favorable or attractive.  For price target, I think the pandemic fair value, if you can call it that, given the company's standing and streaming advantages as well the whole esports thing, at somewhere in the mid teens. Like I said it was trading at $15-16 for the vast majority of the spring and summer.  I think in Q1 you'll see the stock climb to $15 range. Pumps will happen with any virus/vaccine/stimulus-related news. The stock has actually been a great baraometer of the general indexes during the covid situation (but exaggerated, which makes it a money making opportunity).  I've rode the wave several times and was just surprised that when I searched it on WSB there has been next to nothign said about it. If it was based in USA, it would be fully meme stock vibes.

Not sure it will reach the $34 dollars even post lockdown but ya even if it reaches $15-20 could be a good play.  But chances are in this market it could fly to ridiculous heights just given the wild swings.  I 100% agree that this would be a meme stock if not Canadian but maybe it being a Canadian stock it becomes an even bigger joke than GME.",

I suppose an ETF (products like that were very uncommon back then) would mitigate some risk- and picking winners would be a low probability gambling play unless you had industry knowledge and knew WTF you were looking at- but there are likely going to be winners and losers here.  Getting on the right side of this after a massive short term runup (which has indeed happened- we're about 3X from the Pre-COVID high of $3x) is risky. Maybe it continues to go up, but maybe it doesn't. That isn't something worth investing in, most of the time.   I'm trying to learn as much as I can about the industry itself, where the money will be made, what IP can (and will be) protected and reconcile all that against the patterns I saw in the 90s. Also have a stomach for that 10+ year hold, or even 20+ year hold... and watching big gains go back to sleep again for 2 or 3 years. Its hard, but its how you play emerging game-changers.

I want to be the buzzkill here because this is a set-up for losses; people choose time and time again, study after study, to go with active managers that have succeeded failing to realize that you needed to do that before, not after, so the interest in genetics is backwards.

Now this is my personal opinion so grain of salt here, but if I was to buy a used game I would much rather get it from a store where I can easily return or exchange it if there is a problem.

Lets say you're really really good. You can do 40% in the next 11 months considering how tightened up the market is since March.   The value of PSTH, to answer your question, since this is a Q and A, is that once you consume enough info on all aspects of the play (the capped downside, the CEO, the climate, the spac size, the incentive, the S1, the investor list, the pool of targets), you quickly realize that this is a 200% stock in 12 months at minimum.

Also, gamestop lets you reserve the game months out with $5, so you can essentially put it on layaway and get the copy day one, the second its released.    There is also a limit on how many consoles a retailer can get in stock, so while all the online only retailers are sold out, gamestop has direct distribution to the end users.  They can also act as a service portal ( if positioned right ).  Gamestop also offers exclusive content with new games as another way to get people to buy from them.   Finally, i buy all the games i want to play used, from them, i imagine there are many more people doing it as well since not everyone needs play them day one nor wants to pay full price( which is more of a protest over the $70-80 price for me since they sell millions of copies ).

I was going to let this post go, but I have to interject here, as it contains so many flaws and holes in it and also you come across so rude and condescending.   Bluntly speaking, I don\u2019t know your age, risk parameters or what you do and I don\u2019t care. But know this, as a 1099 employee prepare to give a ton of your stated income to the IRS. Also, while you can have both a SEP and an Individual 401k there is no reason to! You only get the tax benefit from one. You may have a very questionable CPA. Also, while tax deferral is great, it is only recognized when you pull the money out, and either it\u2019s a 10% prepay, if under 59 1/2, plus added income tax or just added income tax. Either way, you will pay extra in taxes when you pull the money out unless it\u2019s in a ROTH and there may be some hiccups with that in the future. Have no illusions!! Yes, tax deferral is nice and I truly believe in having many multiple different accounts for different purposes, but I don\u2019t think you really understand this.   Also, you cannot really trade spec. options inside of IRAs. Only protective options. Most people on WSB want to shoot for the moon or make spec trades quickly. I\u2019m glad you admit to your luck and lack of trading knowledge. At least we agree on that.   Your long winded post is just full of fluff. A lot of hot air with no good advice. So many of us here have 7 figure + accounts, but we don\u2019t offer crappy investment advice along with coming across like an ass.  Saying you would be happy making 25-30% a year while also admitting to not really being a good investor, never using options and mostly being lucky is so funny!! Even the most astute intelligent investors hope for a 8-10% yearly return. You sir are a pure clown!   Lastly, please let me know where you play poker, you sound like a tight nit! Lol.   My advice, be humble and grateful. And never offer investment / trading advice if you have no real clue. Happy holidays!",

I'm excited about new companies that might be out there that Cathie is looking at, because there's tons of room for more genetics businesses that are tailored to specific industries. Most is geared towards health now, instead of the smart factories of the future. There's room for an Elon in this field if anybody really wants to be a billionaire and hasn't picked a career yet.

The company is certainly undervalued at present though. And the rise in online stuff and its being well-positioned is a good thing. The fact it will only increase its Canadian standing is also a good thing. There is also some uncertainty as to whether the cineworld pullout is actually legal, in my understanding.   Someone commented that it was to do with the company's longstanding debt. That's untrue, it was to do with a pandemic that made such a purpose by another movie company (suffering similarly) obviously less favorable or attractive.  For price target, I think the pandemic fair value, if you can call it that, given the company's standing and streaming advantages as well the whole esports thing, at somewhere in the mid teens.

I suppose an ETF (products like that were very uncommon back then) would mitigate some risk- and picking winners would be a low probability gambling play unless you had industry knowledge and knew WTF you were looking at- but there are likely going to be winners and losers here.  Getting on the right side of this after a massive short term runup (which has indeed happened- we're about 3X from the Pre-COVID high of $3x) is risky. Maybe it continues to go up, but maybe it doesn't. That isn't something worth investing in, most of the time.   I'm trying to learn as much as I can about the industry itself, where the money will be made, what IP can (and will be) protected and reconcile all that against the patterns I saw in the 90s. Also have a stomach for that 10+ year hold, or even 20+ year hold... and watching big gains go back to sleep again for 2 or 3 years. Its hard, but its how you play emerging game-changers.

I want to be the buzzkill here because this is a set-up for losses; people choose time and time again, study after study, to go with active managers that have succeeded failing to realize that you needed to do that before, not after, so the interest in genetics is backwards.  I do *not* recommend this. Genetic manipulation has been around likely before you were born and we just managed to make [and approve lab grown meat](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/02/no-kill-lab-grown-meat-to-go-on-sale-for-first-time) this very year in this very month. It sounds *way* cooler than it will be for the next 20 to 50 years so you'll be holding them bags ultra heavy as these companies flare up and die down over and over again. I'm not saying this to be mean but I am saying it because it is very risky to assume that because something is in vogue now it is worth holding in the future.   I mean if you want to, play straddles, wide puts, ntm calls, that's probably the smartest play here, because I can see EDIT and other companies just flatlining in the next 3 years since people expect miracles that ... well they don't come like that in medicine. They just don't. Biotech and the like is wild right now but not because of technological progress.  TL;DR: This is a bad bet that actually is a psychological trap that almost ever investor falls for once which is a posteriori thinking; because it is successful it will stay successful and because it is interesting now it will stay interesting are really bad considerations seeing as if it were good years ago and you didn't care there's no reason why it's suddenly good now and there is no reason why it would be suddenly delicious in the future either.",

Now this is my personal opinion so grain of salt here, but if I was to buy a used game I would much rather get it from a store where I can easily return or exchange it if there is a problem. I think the big play with the used equipment will be if they can expand what they take in.

We look at it as market cap rather than just units or sales because it allows us to speculate into the future of these industries. Batteries &amp; solar can be valued higher than their current worth because it\u2019s assumed they\u2019ll grow with tech and legislation - it\u2019s also how speculative \u201cbubbles\u201d form.   Now, cars as an industry is huge and fluctuates with demand only so much, as people need cars. But EVs are relatively a very very small industry. There is potential to increase from its single % market share of the overall car industry, to likely become the largest slice of that pie in time. A similar thing applies to energy - it\u2019s becoming increasingly renewable, and that not only increases the demand for solar but also stationary energy storage aka batteries.   Not even to mention the trillion dollar industry that will be autonomous vehicles some point in the future, TSLA sits at the intersection of several key innovative industries with leading tech in a bull market. Boomer Professional analysts were, until a few months ago I shit you not, still saying TSLA is just a car company. The reason so many retail folks made money off those shorts is because it\u2019s technically and literally wrong. They operate within the \u2018EV\u2019 slice of the \u201ccars\u201d pie exclusively - so the key prediction is that they\u2019ll retain a large portion of that slice as it begins to encompass the whole by 2030 when gas powered vehicles are no longer being sold"

Not even to mention the trillion dollar industry that will be autonomous vehicles some point in the future, TSLA sits at the intersection of several key innovative industries with leading tech in a bull market. Boomer Professional analysts were, until a few months ago I shit you not, still saying TSLA is just a car company. The reason so many retail folks made money off those shorts is because it\u2019s technically and literally wrong. They operate within the \u2018EV\u2019 slice of the \u201ccars\u201d pie exclusively - so the key prediction is that they\u2019ll retain a large portion of that slice as it begins to encompass the whole by 2030 when gas powered vehicles are no longer being sold"

I believe this will not be resolved till September in any case so cineworld can see how things turn out and either pay to settle or just include this in the bankruptcy.  Cineplex is the only major Canadian movie theatre chain nationwide and movies are sorely missed. If you guys sre happy staying st home watching Netflix or whatever then that\u2019s good for you. However, movie theatres in COVID free or reduced areas bounce back immediately after COVID is cleared  There will be bumps in the road but by June we should see 15$",
            "If you've got stock it's not the worst play. Blockbuster took a 4 or 5 years to die when it was still clear they were done and it was disrupted severely with completely new tech after making the horrible decision not to invest in NFLX. GME is trying to catch the tiger by the tail but internet infrastructure is much more accessible now.   It's biggest threat is digital downloads and the console wars freezing them out of the market as a funneled locale for purchases and their lack of continuing or passive revenue. Most their profits stop at point of sale and that's an issue when so many things are becoming subscriptions or services."

            "For you dumbasses who can't get around the paywall:  A convicted SAC Capital Advisors LP analyst at the center of a federal criminal probe of insider trading passed inside information to SAC fund manager Gabriel Plotkin, according to internal e-mails and two people familiar with the matter.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said last week in a court filing that the analyst, Jon Horvath, funneled nonpublic information on technology stocks to two unidentified portfolio managers at Steven Cohen\u2019s $15 billion hedge fund. The men then traded on the information, reaping more than $6 million for SAC Capital. Previously, only one had been identified in a separate court case: SAC fund manager Michael Steinberg.  The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed the same day as its $616 million insider trading settlement with two SAC units, cited the same e-mails included as evidence by prosecutors in the trial of two of Horvath\u2019s co-defendants. In those messages, Horvath passed information that came from inside Dell Inc. and Nvidia Corp., previewing earnings announcements. Steinberg and Plotkin, listed as recipients, exchanged messages with Horvath, according to the government\u2019s evidence.  \u201cIt\u2019s rarely good news to be mentioned in such detailed fashion by the U.S. like this,\u201d said Anthony Sabino, who teaches law at St. John\u2019s University in New York.  \u201cNotwithstanding the settlements that SAC Capital has reached with the SEC, which are very narrow in scope, it still leaves the door wide open to further civil litigation and potential criminal prosecution for others mentioned in the SEC\u2019s complaint,\u201d Sabino said.  SAC Units The government has been charging hedge fund employees and obtaining the cooperation of many as it pursues insider cases, including one against Cohen himself, who is being investigated. Since the five-year crackdown on market corruption began, at least nine current or former SAC Capital employees have been tied to allegations of illegal trading. Four have pleaded guilty. Cohen hasn\u2019t been sued or charged, and has denied any wrongdoing.  Plotkin, 34, didn\u2019t return a message seeking comment left at his home. The SEC\u2019s March 15 complaint against the SAC units didn\u2019t name him or Steinberg, or indicate whether they knew Horvath\u2019s information was obtained illegally. Horvath pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government.  Portfolio Managers Neither Steinberg, a 15-year veteran of SAC Capital, nor Plotkin, one of 10 portfolio managers at its Sigma Capital Management unit focusing on consumer stocks, has been accused of any wrongdoing.  Plotkin did \u201cnothing wrong\u201d and \u201chas built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research,\u201d Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC Capital, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. \u201cPlotkin lost over $6 million that day on a large Dell long position. He owned 1.8 million shares and 3,000 of Oct. 24 call options.\u201d  Plotkin, who lives on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, joined SAC in 2006 and is among the firm\u2019s top portfolio managers, overseeing more than $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the firm.  Steinberg was one of 15 SAC Capital portfolio managers handling technology, media and telecommunications stocks before he was placed on leave in September, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak about the case.  \u2018Detailed Analysis\u2019 Steinberg has done \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong,\u201d said his lawyer, Barry Berke. \u201cAt all times his trading decisions were based on detailed analysis as well as information that he understood had been properly obtained.\u201d  Plotkin\u2019s identity was revealed in e-mails submitted as government evidence in the trial last year of Horvath co-defendants Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of Level Global Investors LP co-founder, and former Diamondback Capital Management LLC portfolio manager Todd Newman.  Chiasson and Newman were convicted on federal insider trading charges in December and await sentencing in Manhattan federal court. They face as long as 25 years in prison.  A comparison of the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the same court, with the e-mail evidence from that trial indicates Steinberg, Horvath\u2019s supervisor, and Plotkin are the two men who executed the multimillion-dollar trades described by the securities regulator.  Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara\u2019s office, and John Nestor, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment on the agency\u2019s allegations or the two recipients of Horvath\u2019s e-mails.  Horvath\u2019s Tips The Justice Department and the SEC previously identified Steinberg as the lone Sigma fund manager who traded on Horvath\u2019s tips on Dell, the Round-Rock, Texas-based computer manufacturer, and Nvidia, the Santa Clara, California-based maker of graphics processors. New York-based Sigma, with about $2 billion of assets under management, earned $1.4 million from Horvath\u2019s tips, according to a federal grand jury indictment of him in August.  The SEC\u2019s new complaint against Sigma, filed as part of last week\u2019s SEC settlement of insider-trading claims tied to technology and pharmaceutical stocks, shows that Horvath\u2019s tips on Dell were passed to two fund managers, helping Sigma earn or avoid losses which the U.S. now tallies at more than $6 million.  SAC and its affiliates settled the SEC\u2019s claims of insider trading without admitting or denying wrongdoing. George Canellos, the regulator\u2019s acting enforcement director, said the accord doesn\u2019t preclude the commission from pursuing others at SAC.  The SEC\u2019s investigation of the Stamford, Connecticut-based hedge fund is continuing, Canellos said. While the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney Bharara may initiate criminal prosecutions, the SEC is restricted to lawsuits with no penalty of incarceration."

Scotiabank is one of the largest banks in Canada with operations elsewhere. The deal being struck is more important than the size of the bank, don't distract from the actual points being made.  As for Canada being more strict, Canada has a patchwork situation much like the states. Places hardest hit have gone into lockdown again, yes, but that happened before and places like Ontario (conservative government) had to do it. Other huge provinces hit by covid hard include Quebec and Alberta. All have policies more in keeping with a place like Texas, for example.   Simply stating the obvious that locations in the dark of a covid winter are in lockdown is not a respectable point of argument.  Under your brilliant logic tons of plays other than PLTR are bad choices. Lots of value in this market for companies suffering with covid. Hilton Worldwide is a great example.  Cineplex is the only chain in Canada, the contention its slowly dying is not substantiated by any actual financial evidence. If it was \"slowly dying\" why is Universal striking huge deals with them in the middle of a pandemic?",

            "At least you read the DD. I am of course not against PLTR or other sources of tendies. I just find attractive value deals that others under appreciate very attractive.  Scotiabank is one of the largest banks in Canada with operations elsewhere. The deal being struck is more important than the size of the bank, don't distract from the actual points being made.  As for Canada being more strict, Canada has a patchwork situation much like the states. Places hardest hit have gone into lockdown again, yes, but that happened before and places like Ontario (conservative government) had to do it. Other huge provinces hit by covid hard include Quebec and Alberta. All have policies more in keeping with a place like Texas, for example.   Simply stating the obvious that locations in the dark of a covid winter are in lockdown is not a respectable point of argument.  Under your brilliant logic tons of plays other than PLTR are bad choices. Lots of value in this market for companies suffering with covid. Hilton Worldwide is a great example.  Cineplex is the only chain in Canada, the contention its slowly dying is not substantiated by any actual financial evidence. If it was \"slowly dying\" why is Universal striking huge deals with them in the middle of a pandemic?",

HHS has stressed that the Tiberius program won\u2019t have access to sensitive health information.  Officials anticipate that the Tiberius system can optimize the delivery of vaccines to facilities administering the vaccine.  A management system like sale force could tell Tiberius how many vaccines the hospital has ministered and how many vaccines it has left to minister.   All automated. PLTR ISNT COMPETITION HERE.

            "It\u2019s a stupid question, mostly because it\u2019s been all over this sub and retail investing on the internet in general all year long, but here\u2019s something  Ford - they make cars. Cars is an xxxxbillion dollar market. They make some % of cars, ergo they earn the revenue from that % of the market.  So some xxbillion, and we\u2019ll say Ford is worth about that much.   Tesla - battery tech, autonomous driving, solar &amp; energy storage, [...], ELECTRIC VEHICLES. Each those industries has a market value to be capitalized on and you\u2019ll notice EVs are not all of the \u2018cars\u2019 umbrella. In fact, you might say right now that since EVs are such a small % of cars sales that despite all the other stuff, they should be worth less than Ford for instance.  We look at it as market cap rather than just units or sales because it allows us to speculate into the future of these industries. Batteries &amp; solar can be valued higher than their current worth because it\u2019s assumed they\u2019ll grow with tech and legislation - it\u2019s also how speculative \u201cbubbles\u201d form.   Now, cars as an industry is huge and fluctuates with demand only so much, as people need cars. But EVs are relatively a very very small industry. There is potential to increase from its single % market share of the overall car industry, to likely become the largest slice of that pie in time. A similar thing applies to energy - it\u2019s becoming increasingly renewable, and that not only increases the demand for solar but also stationary energy storage aka batteries.   Not even to mention the trillion dollar industry that will be autonomous vehicles some point in the future, TSLA sits at the intersection of several key innovative industries with leading tech in a bull market. Boomer Professional analysts were, until a few months ago I shit you not, still saying TSLA is just a car company. The reason so many retail folks made money off those shorts is because it\u2019s technically and literally wrong. They operate within the \u2018EV\u2019 slice of the \u201ccars\u201d pie exclusively - so the key prediction is that they\u2019ll retain a large portion of that slice as it begins to encompass the whole by 2030 when gas powered vehicles are no longer being sold",
            "Yup.  I held a lot of TSLA through its 5 years of doing nearly nothing. I bought after the huge rise from about 20 to 170 in a short amount of time, aka right at the top of a \"bubble\" that everyone was calling.  Still absolutely destroyed the average S&amp;P index returns over my entire investing time period.  I think there's a good chance ARKG will be a similar story in 5-10 years too, I just don't want to bet on individual companies in this space.",

If this goes up to 200 in a day and goes to 15 the next they made money on their 16 short.   The console cycle is a large event but it is only an event. Most of you didn't care GME had a ticker a year ago, remember? Everyone knows it and this game is long. That's why Tesla shorts are so wildly confusing; They're just burning out due to capital weight but that's 60 to 2500 not 4 to maybe 50 or 60.   TL;DR: Melvin will be fine. You have no opponents.

            "The opportunity cost alone is expensive. Then you add in a borrow fee on top of that (albeit low) and that's a pretty expensive price to pay for a trade that's not guaranteed to go in your favor no matter how long you wait it out. And that's the point I think you're overlooking. It is not a given that Game Stop keeps marching towards bankruptcy. It has survived some extremely negative catalysts and remains debt free with several positive catalysts on the horizon. It is entirely possible that GME is able to turn things around and find its niche for the long term. And if/once that becomes more apparent the whole \"wait it out\" thesis goes out the window. Translation: moon mission, baby.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, I like how you use Tesla as an example. How'd that work out for the shorts?

            "Gamestop doesn't need to go bankrupt. It just needs to no longer be favorable. It was a penny stock before a ridiculous amount of people got interested but nothing prevents it from becoming that again unless there is a fundamentally game changing structural difference in Gamestop. Things go up and then they go down, it can take days, weeks or years.  As for opportunity cost that's something that we can't decide for any other person; if you have nothing else to do with the money or a strategy that plays with the money using hedges or anything like that then perhaps the Op Cost is covered or even negative and it's extremely advantageous to do. Without a known public understanding of what the entire trade looks like in all legs we just can't know. I mean if anything they might be shorting the stock and holding calls to pay for the short itself which would be fine and brilliant; let the long-side pay for the short much like letting the short-side pay for the long.  I used Tesla as an example on purpose. Tesla is important because it did shake off shorts *but* people had been shorting Tesla for years and there was no deterrence. The fact is that without that jump those II's *were able to hold the positions indefinitely*. That's the scale of the game. These guys were able to lose money consistently for 5~8 years before 2020 hit and they couldn't hold the shares anymore because of demand taking them out of the trades by force. I think in 2014 or 2015 it was like 1 quarter of all shares were loaned or something.  Basically if you're worried about this you need to think on a much grander scale; in a game of trillions billions don't matter.",

            "I started investing on june..&amp; i learn to not go all in on a stock that i havent done no DD on...i got into stocks that had already run up 30-40% ... i messed with penny stocks instead of smart investing like Microsoft, tesla, apple, adobe, ark..etc you get my point...I also learned that im super emotional with options and penny stocks, so i switched into long term plays and smart plays..Nio, tesla, sbe are the ones that got me back on my feet ! Best of luck brother!",
            "Mix of SPY, AAPL, and TSLA calls/puts. Last run up were a few PANW calls. All plays were FD\u2019s. Not holding any current positions.",

            "Would a Microsoft EV be a luxury car or a economic car? I don\u2019t view it as quite the luxurious brand. When I think Microsoft I think shitty Windows computers at my old public high school. I just don\u2019t get how they would brand this. It would have to be a spin off IP and it would stand no chance against Tesla or Porche. The Windows Car\u2122 would have to either be the lowest costing EV or the EV with the best tech. I don\u2019t think Microsoft will have either of those advantages. This is just MS trend hoping    Maybe the Xbox car. It would be a huge meme and people would buy it for that reason",
            "You don't know people that got engineering degrees, do you? I have a friend that went to school for engineering in Michigan, he knows a fuckton of people from auto makers. He, himself just got offered a job at Tesla in Cali or Texas, his choice. He'll be my friend forever.",

Tesla has shown it\u2019s possible and as of right now has no competition in this space since everyone else is dicking around with lidar. If Microsoft can pull it off with a vision system quick enough, then I expect their system to be purchased by all major automakers aside from Tesla. Just like your dell runs windows, your car will have Cortana driving.",
            "I think the big tech companies realized the potential of ev and the resulting opportunity by electric vehicle power, which is not possible on current models.  They waited to see a proof that it will adopt by users to calc. the potential / Business case.  You can integrate a lot of IT stuff (Office, Mails, TV, VR, ... new stuff...) in the moment you have autonomous driving and enough electric power, based on technical standpoint.  As example: Microsoft is big as they are, based on the pc operating System *Integration* on all new pcs. Think about.   Sounds to me like the start of the biggest technology opportunity in the next 30 years, from an IT perspective.   Tl;dr buy MS/Tesla/AAPL",
            "OP thanks for taking the time to type this up and share it with us. You are probably right and that Cathy chick and her crew are super smart and have been correct on mostly everything since I've been following them, including and especially Tesla.  I'm hesitant to buy ARKG when its this close to its 52 week high and I think we are going to have a big dip soon but when we do have that big dip I will buy both shares and LEAPS that are as far out as far as possible. In the meantime will be selling puts on red-days",
            "I'm curious...what does your DD consist of? For a company like $TSLA. What due diligence is needed to justify its price?",
            "Well I started last year with mostly Tesla and Nvidia, I sold my Nvidia position recently and went for Nio, Plug Power and a few others.",
            "It\u2019s a stupid question, mostly because it\u2019s been all over this sub and retail investing on the internet in general all year long, but here\u2019s something  Ford - they make cars. Cars is an xxxxbillion dollar market. They make some % of cars, ergo they earn the revenue from that % of the market.  So some xxbillion, and we\u2019ll say Ford is worth about that much.   Tesla - battery tech, autonomous driving, solar &amp; energy storage, [...], ELECTRIC VEHICLES. Each those industries has a market value to be capitalized on and you\u2019ll notice EVs are not all of the \u2018cars\u2019 umbrella. In fact, you might say right now that since EVs are such a small % of cars sales that despite all the other stuff, they should be worth less than Ford for instance.  We look at it as market cap rather than just units or sales because it allows us to speculate into the future of these industries. Batteries &amp; solar can be valued higher than their current worth because it\u2019s assumed they\u2019ll grow with tech and legislation - it\u2019s also how speculative \u201cbubbles\u201d form.   Now, cars as an industry is huge and fluctuates with demand only so much, as people need cars. But EVs are relatively a very very small industry. There is potential to increase from its single % market share of the overall car industry, to likely become the largest slice of that pie in time. A similar thing applies to energy - it\u2019s becoming increasingly renewable, and that not only increases the demand for solar but also stationary energy storage aka batteries.   Not even to mention the trillion dollar industry that will be autonomous vehicles some point in the future, TSLA sits at the intersection of several key innovative industries with leading tech in a bull market. Boomer Professional analysts were, until a few months ago I shit you not, still saying TSLA is just a car company. The reason so many retail folks made money off those shorts is because it\u2019s technically and literally wrong. They operate within the \u2018EV\u2019 slice of the \u201ccars\u201d pie exclusively - so the key prediction is that they\u2019ll retain a large portion of that slice as it begins to encompass the whole by 2030 when gas powered vehicles are no longer being sold",
            "Yup.  I held a lot of TSLA through its 5 years of doing nearly nothing. I bought after the huge rise from about 20 to 170 in a short amount of time, aka right at the top of a \"bubble\" that everyone was calling.  Still absolutely destroyed the average S&amp;P index returns over my entire investing time period.  I think there's a good chance ARKG will be a similar story in 5-10 years too, I just don't want to bet on individual companies in this space.",
            "The only thing this lot is up against is itself. Institutional shorting can and does last *years*. And much like shares going up shorts don't lose money until they sell. If this goes up to 200 in a day and goes to 15 the next they made money on their 16 short.   The console cycle is a large event but it is only an event. Most of you didn't care GME had a ticker a year ago, remember? Everyone knows it and this game is long. That's why Tesla shorts are so wildly confusing; They're just burning out due to capital weight but that's 60 to 2500 not 4 to maybe 50 or 60.   TL;DR: Melvin will be fine. You have no opponents. Just enjoy the earnings and move on.",
            "Why wouldn't the squeeze look like what TSLA has been doing all year? I'm assuming all those times it mooned for no reason were from squeezes.",
            "Actually, it may look like what Tesla has done this year. Only difference is; the GME stock will go down fast &amp; hard. Whereas Tesla will probably just have some drawbacks, but still be trading within the range of it\u2019s new price.",
            "The opportunity cost alone is expensive. Then you add in a borrow fee on top of that (albeit low) and that's a pretty expensive price to pay for a trade that's not guaranteed to go in your favor no matter how long you wait it out. And that's the point I think you're overlooking. It is not a given that Game Stop keeps marching towards bankruptcy. It has survived some extremely negative catalysts and remains debt free with several positive catalysts on the horizon. It is entirely possible that GME is able to turn things around and find its niche for the long term. And if/once that becomes more apparent the whole \"wait it out\" thesis goes out the window. Translation: moon mission, baby.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, I like how you use Tesla as an example. How'd that work out for the shorts? Seems you almost proved the point that stockholders will eventually be rewarded if they hold long.",
            "Gamestop doesn't need to go bankrupt. It just needs to no longer be favorable. It was a penny stock before a ridiculous amount of people got interested but nothing prevents it from becoming that again unless there is a fundamentally game changing structural difference in Gamestop. Things go up and then they go down, it can take days, weeks or years.  As for opportunity cost that's something that we can't decide for any other person; if you have nothing else to do with the money or a strategy that plays with the money using hedges or anything like that then perhaps the Op Cost is covered or even negative and it's extremely advantageous to do. Without a known public understanding of what the entire trade looks like in all legs we just can't know. I mean if anything they might be shorting the stock and holding calls to pay for the short itself which would be fine and brilliant; let the long-side pay for the short much like letting the short-side pay for the long.  I used Tesla as an example on purpose. Tesla is important because it did shake off shorts *but* people had been shorting Tesla for years and there was no deterrence. The fact is that without that jump those II's *were able to hold the positions indefinitely*. That's the scale of the game. These guys were able to lose money consistently for 5~8 years before 2020 hit and they couldn't hold the shares anymore because of demand taking them out of the trades by force. I think in 2014 or 2015 it was like 1 quarter of all shares were loaned or something.  Basically if you're worried about this you need to think on a much grander scale; in a game of trillions billions don't matter."

            "Stellar find. Thanks for the great insight, and all of your DD and contributions, Uber. It's going to be a great year for GME, the most hated and loved stock in the land. Holding strong.",
            "Thanks for putting all the hard work in your DDs Uber, I always get so amped up reading all the in depth reasons of why GME is getting ready to moon!",
            "Pardon me Mr Uber but since you seem to know this shit well, how much are Melvin and their friends paying per month and per share to borrow all these shares they're shorting? At what point would it become to painful to keep doing it?  Positions: 5500 shares. Apri 16: 43 calls at 9, 13, 20, and -18 puts at 10. (Expecting this to hit 30-90 without a squeeze)",
            "Uber, you son of a gun, if I wasn\u2019t already in I WOULD BE after reading this hotness  Anyone looking to enter:  TL;DR buy shares  Please be careful in this high IV environment and grab some shares, grab some options if we see IV drop. It\u2019s not worth fighting IV and theta when you will still make money on shares. It is possible to be completely right about strike and date and still lose money to IV/theta",
            "For sure, my comments were more for anyone out there reading this trying to decide between potentially throwing their weekly lunch money at either 50% otm FDs or shares   Always appreciate your perspective and posts Uber",
            "Many thanks Uber Rod.  Glad to hear you think highly of RK.  I've caught a couple of his streams, and his GME energy is infectious.  I'll see if I can dig up a high-res of the astronaut meme, that's a great idea."
