2,Got a few 12/24 $627.50 puts today for .95 tesla lottery
3,"If we break 622, it’s downhill from there to 598, possibly much lower as time goes on. Won’t be a sharp correction. 550 and below I’m sure people start buying like crazy again. IMO Definitely buy if it goes down to the 360-500 range."

20,People still don’t fully understand that China is ruled by communists ...
21,You didn’t get the memo bud? We’re not doing nio anymore it’s been replaced with QS XL and any cyber security stock under $20. Check back next year
22,Only once it hits the $55-$60 range. If it goes below $44 again then close all positions for a loss. Sorry I thought that part was obvious.
23,Been sitting on $21 12/24 calls since like October so tomorrow is gonna be insane
24,All Chinese were hands off BABA's HKG twin for reason. Ma got forced into retirement by Pooh and replaced with a army puppet. The Ant IPO is essentially big fuck you so of course he incurred the wrath of the emperor.

30,"Mostly a blur, but the streak of no consecutive down days finally came to an end today which in some ways is a relief. I started contemplating work and the value of all this shit.  Friday, got lucky fills on TSLA, but also had a piece of shit exercise four $140 calls that we're slightly otm at expiration. The acquisition put me behind the 8 ball on Tuesday, opened up down 8k. And today, whatever.. I stepped out to shoot some hoops while the market was panicking at the Trump dump."
31,yup buy high sell low the WSB classic

33,Is it the right time to sell psth since it's on wsb now?
34,Umm hell no.. only way I'm selling is if they are merging with some BS company

37,$300/share and I could retire.  The last time I got this erect from DD that wasn’t my own I proceeded to lose a quarter of my account balance over the next 6 months.  Fuck it.  I’m not selling.
38,Squeeze that mop really good. Might as well get some practice in before we do the same thing to those peabrained Melvin short fucks.
39,You are buying a new one soon so IDGAF!
40,So basically in person Swappa?
41,GME gang has officially lost their goddamn minds
42,These captions are next level thanks for the tendies
43,The trade-in/ resell avenue with more consumer electronics gets me way to hard. Thanks for the DD 🚀🚀🚀
44,I never noticed the word “Investing” before. Seems like a slap in the face.
45,Now confide in yourself to hold til 123.45 and then reevaluate
46,QS has 0 products and 0 revenue until 2024. Plug is hemorrhaging money. Both will collapse in 2021
47,22.67.  Bought them a little before earnings and thought they'd be fucking worthless after the dip but it honestly wasn't even worth it to close
48,There is so much delusion here it’s almost believable. They sell a product for the same price that anyone can get at a click of a button from their own home. Get out now while you can
49,And jack ma pissed off the dictator
50,"GME is your best friend! He has a very Nice mom, and if You give him 5 candies, he Will give You 25 candies on your birthday"
51,Why not just sell the put? A 30p for 1/15 got me 560 lowering my cost basis to something like 23.5-24.
52,I think im gonna move in on ARCT tomorrow. Maybe. Stock chart looks so good.......
53,"No one really knows exactly how it will go, but if it goes down, it will go back up, higher than before.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**    I won't be surprised if Cohen even surprises us with good news, just to make our Christmas a little nicer."
54,26 2/17 50 c’s reporting for duty -7 percent as of now. Was down -30 percent last week.
55,If it wasnt for comments like this I would’ve already lost my bank account. Im in on the GME play 🚀 but I think caution is always important
56,Too much buying power used up. With the spread I'm using a few bucks per contract You're using 25 per.
57,but but but look at all the productssss on the website!
58,"I predict a similar morning to today. First, big buys and sells seeing if the other is making a move. Eventually volume will pick up and cohen or whatever hedges have been buying the last couple days are gonna buy it up to 23 or 24 over the course of the short day - the good guys will want to end on a high note to fuck with Melvins head over the long weekend."
59,"Ngl bro, with cohen in, I see it"
60,I can’t wait to make bank on this YOLO so I can take a shit in this goddamn mop bucket and leave it for the opening manager.
61,Already all in
62,"Is that half on margin or cash on hand? If on margin sell cc .30 delta weeklies and make that monthly car payment 2x or more If not on margin, sell for gain and sell 5 puts atm and wheel.

63,I made 25% on it already I like it a lot too
64,Don’t worry. I saw heavy sweeps and block trades  for January 👀 LETSSS GOOO TOOO MOOOONNNNN 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
65,Almost sold my position for like a $300 loss because of this earlier today but stayed in fml.
66,Lol. I bet it hits low 25 again. It was low 25s when I opened my shares a week ago. I don't know what the pump was about today. I'd see a price target and let it go. I think today's pump was manipulation.
67,"Looks like you held too long, f"
68,"I used to work in a soild state battery lab in college. The shit will change the world, but it has some near to impossible technical hurdles to overcome first. I emailed QS to see if theyd managed to fix the problems our lab had, so far no response. They've released 0 technicals. None. Its super easy in the battery world to make good data and a shit battery. So far no proof that theyve reliably fixed dendroid growth in the llzo, conductivity in the cathode and good surface contact with the llzo, and the ability to sinter together materials with wildly different melting points. And theyre doping with aluminum but i think ------ was better (dont quote me on that)"
69,"It can compete with Amazon in certain sectors like games and pc parts. It can outcompete Amazon by offering better service, more consistency, and faster shipping for those items. Nobody expects GameStop prime to deliver their toothpaste."
70,"End goal - ever read 1984? If you want to know who is in control, ask yourself who you can't criticize."
71,That’s at least a 20pc nugget
72,"Exactly it’s all hype. They’ve said they don’t plan on rolling out products until 2024.   I’d look at Microvast. They are going to go public through THCB, they actually have a product that’s been out for years, and their batteries are the same as QS says their future batteries will be"
73,This is excellent work. As a cofounder of the GME OG Gang I formally commend your utter retardation and smashed the upvote.
74,Always look for what gets you fucked in a trade. Originally I wrote died but n word sounded worse in 2020
75,Looks like you have some baba so that should help you recover!
76,"Damn, I’m guessing those weren’t puts."
77,"Kinda like Godfather 2, this isn't as good as the original but we await 3"
78,You are missing at least one zero and where tf are the shares?
79,You can't even buy a $5 foot long with that money.
80,"Where the fuck are the PS5s on Amazon. I was avale to buy a couple on GameStop... you know what I did, I fucking clicked."
81,Cohen did it with chewy so I think he knows how to strategically make gme to attractive to consumers. With a company specializing in a the gaming field I think it will be able to provide more value than amazon who does not focus on that industry specifically
82,"Ah I see, GME to the moon! 🚀 🚀 🚀"
83,You’re parents were right all along
84,So QS is pretty much next NKLA?
85,"I looked them up and thyre doing something completely different - i dont know much about their tech. All i can say is that theres a lot of snake oil in the experimental battery industry.   Basically, you have to educated guess 8 hours a day 5 days a week on new shit to throw in your battery till something works. Thats why the tech evolves so slow.  Oh. And you cant even make solid state batteries in air. You have to assemble them in a big argon tank. Thats scalable!"
86,Which one are you most excited/bullish for?
87,"Hey OP, big follower into the GME story. 700 shares(cb 14.50) and a few calls here and there. Love the write ups you've posted these few days. Wanted to give you some food for thought on your write-up tomorrow. We are most likely getting our bi-monthly report on short data (hopefully). With all this frantic buying WSB and RC(combined easily 20%+) has done, along with, im sure, other retail investors that see gme mooning and want to get in. The float is DRASTICALLY going down. When the MOASS kicks off, and with float being at least over 101% there are not enough shares to go around. Price could go up to infinity (hyperbole,of course.) You'll also have retail buyers wanting to buy into it because ""OMG I can get riiiich."" Further increasing the exponential outcome. Its so hard to accurately define a specific range that isn't extremely expensive like $100-10000 per share. I'm confident, pending the report that will come out soon, that  having an exit strategy in the $400s will be easily obtainable."
88,"Congrats you can buy one $500 ps5 from them. Are you planning on buying another one next week/month/year? No you won’t. And when you get that ps5 you aren’t ordering physical copies, your going to purchase the games from the online store. To grow your business you need people actually giving you business."

96,"It very well could be. If you dont start seeing more pretty pictures explaining what they are doing id get scared. It looks like theyre using llzo as their electrolyte (from their patents) but they wont even admit that. Its pretty standard. I dont know why they wont just admit that. And if they dont start at least giving hints of what theyre putting in their cathode and how they sinter it to the electrolyte, id get realllll worried.  Also, once the thing is created and works (i think theyd have to be a long way off from that) mass producing it in a no-oxygen environment will be balls to say the least.

GME. 1:16 God made the two green spikes, the greater spike to liquidate Melvin capital, and the lesser spike to fuck 🌈🐻; He made the options also.  GME. 1:17 WSB placed them in the explosion of the short squeeze to give light on the omnichannel gaming revamp,  GME. 1:18 and to govern the traders and the retards, and to separate the cucks from the rich; and Cohen saw that it made tendies."

151,THANK YOU. I’m long GME but tbh the amount of stupid pump posts with incorrect information is making me nervous for the rest of this month. Expectations are through the roof and we know what tends to happen when that’s the case. MMs are not done attacking GME and it’s going to spook a lot of people
152,Thanks for the DD. I think you're on to something.
153,"I guess Baba saga will drag all China fintech down such as JD, Lufax. We will know today 4am how bad it is"
154,There probably be self driving cars on Apple campus and an automated buses for employees who live in the city and commute to the valley. Eventually automated ev buses for major universities. The question is how Apple will make money off of this? Cities and countries (a few not a lot) are going to phase out small gas engines. And that’s the time Apple will take a piece of the ev action.      Tl;dr: 14k in Apple      Hopefully by eoy 2023 be a big ev mooning

158,Hahaa gabe plotkin at Melvin capital is the assholeeee shorting GME. What a turd nugget
159,Hold. You're fine unless you bought Jan 30c?  Shit it may have been insider buying. Just using the data I have.
160,"So, the goal is to make it smaller by volume than a traditional lion. Weight doesn't matter so much. The reason theres not a great answer to this question yet is because we dont know how big the cathode and electrolyte needs to be. The electrolyte needs to be think enough (or smooth enough or hard enough) that lithium metal cant grow through it and short the battery. The cathode will be made of NMC (the shit that holds the energy) but it will also need stuff to boost conductivity and adjust its melting point. This stuff you add to tune it lowers the energy density.   So in short, when finished, it will be hopefully more energy dense than a lion, but theres not really an exact answer less (unless you take qs by their word)"

Do you wait for all these 5 conditions to be met or only one or 50%?  &gt; Only go long in an individual stock once you have a list of conditions. Here are some of my conditions, and they usually work when I swing trade, as an example: The stock is currently trading above the 180 day SMA. The stock has a golden cross on the MACD. The stock has a candle close above the 9 day SMA. The day you enter in the position cannot be a new high. Never hold through earnings."

Ever see the small print ""Used from $12.34 and 23 other offers"" on an Amazon product page? This isn't as good as a dedicated system, but if the niche is large and profitable enough then Amazon will quickly compete.  - Best Buy has a buyback program for used consumer electronics. Or they used to - does Geek Squad still exist? The fact that I have to ask that question means there's limited value in it. More than zero, but limited.  - Storefronts make mediocre distribution centers. Limited space, small loading docks without many bays, located on roads that are made for residential traffic and aren't good at accommodating a constant stream of semis. If we're talking about an online presence that's #2 behind Amazon, their existing real estate is the wrong kind of real estate.  - Amazon offers same day delivery in most major metros. They pride themselves on fast delivery. Let's call that a wash, no advantage to either.  - How engaged are PowerUp members? How many are paying members? This is important because there's a free membership tier. Hell, there are probably still 55M members of the Craftsman Club, just because it's a free club and they can claim anyone who ever signed up for a rewards card.  TL;DR I'm sure RC has a business case, and I do think GME will go up, but like ... To $30 - $35, max. I don't think they'll seriously compete with Amazon, that comparison was a way to get attention."
172,Why not do a spread instead?
173,Puts on FCEL...got it.
174,&gt;Am I fucked?   Possibly. They might completely dismantle this. Might. Might not. Nobody knows.  &gt;How long can this drag on?  Forever. You are fighting against the CCP. You have no chance of winning whatever long gamble you take if the CCP decided to step in.
175,"&gt;  $16 puts the market cap at $1,1B. Amongst 4000 stores. $276,000/store. Try setting up a store in locations Gamestop is set up at, with inventory and trained staff for $276,000.  Really liked this comment. To your point, I work in finance for a large company with several hundred retail stores in Canada, many in malls, and on average it's $28k/mo CAD to run a POD (point of distribution), so roughly $250k/yr USD. Again, just to run one, forget setup and the other reasons you mention."
176,Yeah he worked on an autonomous system in the early years of Project Titan at Apple. Carlson is very well respected in EV/autonomous driving industry. I didn't know there was still any doubt Apple was pushing to develop self driving EVs lol
177,Guess I’ll have to see how bloody it gets tomorrow 🤦🏻‍♂️
178,Not on this platform. Back to Mid-2018 you can dig into my earliest GME public commentary &amp; trades amid shitposting on StockTwits.  I am a part of a loose collective of shareholders that I consider myself a cofounder of: GME OG Gang.
179,Are you buying.BABA calls at these prices?
180,Ty for the info!
181,Whatever nonbeliever!  Ty for the info about borrowdesk tho I will remember this.
182,"Good DD, I still think March 21 calls are the easy way to a 10 bagger. The one thing you got wrong, and the common misconception w/PSTH is that he wants 10% of a Unicorn($1B+). He wants 10% of a Decacorn ($10B+) which significantly narrows his targets and is the primary reason this SPAC is designed the way it is. As an example, RobinHood is a Decacorn $11.2B valuation and would be a perfect target. Doubt it's them given recent IPO rumors, but think on a similar level."
183,"Not when there are better alternatives, Tencent and JD are dropping as well. I don't believe the CCP is going to try to fuck over all of their companies, but BABA is the target for now."
184,"In 2018, Tencent (the largest tech company in China) fell about 35% from its ATH after the Chinese government tightened its rules on approval of western and imported video games. It slid down for months... like a solid 6 months it fell, and then it climbed to its ATH when the dust settled. From fall to recovery it took slightly more than 2 years.  Now it's 2x the value it was from its bottom of mid 2018.  I personally think your leaps are fine, they give you more than enough time to recover. There is no way this thing is trading down for the next 2 years, nor is it trading sideways. The second any sort of news (positive or negative) comes out, it's making movements of near double digits in appropriate direction.  At the end of the day, it's a solid company, and dips are created off fears. Dips are the only way to play the market. I don't do options myself, but if NYSE opens more than 7% down tomorrow, which I have a good feeling it will, then I'm buying my 2nd position, first being yesterday around $256.  Another strategy to use on this may be large movements leading to buys/sells. If after tomorrow, Baba moves up 5% or 10%, I'm cashing out and locking profits on that trade, and minimizing the overall loss. If it keeps climbing, my initial trade recovers, and if it falls again, I buy it again.  **TLDR:** Tencent was caught in a similar position in 2018 and dropped 35% over 6 months and then bounced to 2x the bottom in 2 years. Baba is already down 20% from ATH, and tomorrow that will be widened to at least 26-29%."
185,Agreed. Anyone that's held GME for months knows this is a tough ride.  Most weeks aren't as easy as this week. These pump posts are great for morale but also gonna make people flaky af if things don't pan out
186,"&gt;By not having a huge warehouse and carrying 12 million SKUs, their operation is much more efficient.  Ummm... they have a Warehouse that carries all their SKU's. They ship to Gamestops and D2C all the time via... wait for it... UPS/FEDEX/USPS. Just like Amazon &amp; Ebay.  &gt;Direct to consumer = no middle man = greater connection with consumers as well as greater profit.  Gamestop IS the middleman. We'll talk consoles since PC's and Digital D/L's are eating away at Gamestops profits. Up until recently, you pretty much had to rely on big box stores to get games. Now, physical games are going away. Iwalked into Walmart the other day, to buy condoms for my wife's boyfriend and saw they removed the video game walls. Sign of the times.  To your point, they've had to shift gears and start selling everything BUT games. They acquired ThinkGeek to offset dwindling game sales.   Source: worked there once. Warehouse closed down and moved to an even BIGGER warehouse down the road."
187,It means he’s a technical investor.    What’s that saying I read the other day?  Oh yeah - “investing based on history is like driving forward but looking in the rear view mirror”

Those buyers are fucked, and are everything they can to get their 1 ps5."

All I can say is, I'll be upping my current position by half tomorrow in shares if the USD price drops below $237 tomorrow. Maybe it will trade sideways for a few days or a week. But over months, those slight sideways moves will either become another 5% down or up. I'm going to believe 5% up because otherwise, my buy would make no sense lol."

I cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference.""   -Frank Underwood"
224,"Solid point, not sure about what kind of news drove down BABA (maybe it was the trade war with Trump) but Tencent's drop began in January 2018 and BABA traded sideways from Jan-Aug 2018 and then fell 30% or so. And BIDU's fall began in May same year.  Maybe Tencent had something to do with creating general panic in the market, and US-China relations didn't help but I think Tencent may have started that climb down overall."
225,"I read a comment on another post, apologies for being able to reference, but the buying calls just transfers the risk to the seller but the squeeze still remains."

231,"I've been in on GME since September, The 8th was the announcement of the MSFT deal thats why it was up so much.I remember this day perfectly i was on a boring conference call when this thing got halted and launched over that. The short interest actually GREW during that period.   If the law is enforced that yes they would have been forced to close. They're breaking the law already with naked shorting!   I do share a feeling with you that something big is about to happen tomorrow though I think we might see RC bought even more"
232,You are selling the $30 put and buying the $25 in the same trade. Essentially you’re betting the stock will be above $30 by 4/16/21 so it’s a bullish sentiment. It’s OTM so you get a great return.   Or just buy an OTM call if it’s easier
233,Because Ryan is willing to buy any share at $16 or below. I expect that floor has increased in the past couple days and hope for another SEC filing soon.
234,Has anyone considered that many government officials probably hold shares of these companies and that they’re only doing this for show? After all it IS China.
235,I bought 2 ps5 bundles and and Xbox series X. I’m planning to keep the Xbox series x and you def know why (DD). I offered the other two ps5 to close associates of mine you know why? Because it’s sold out. And it’s going to be like that for the next couple of months. Do I play nba 2k w.e the f no. But at least I got the system (increase rev for GameStop). I’m done
236,It's one day. Stock don't move in straight line. You get a chance hear to pick up world class company that is way undervalued. Jack is just getting big dick right now. He spoke out of turn.   Remember stocks only go up if you hold long enough. And this one is going to rip.
237,How are they up 10X on their short? Their puts are down massively year over year. Its impossible to be up 10X on a short unless ur puts r up i dont get it. Also the same day they closed hella July puts a shit ton of Jan puts opened and all of those bled a shit ton.
238,It’s because retail investors don’t hedge so if you have a bull market of course they will have much higher returns.
239,"Chinese officials take direct cash bribes up to the hundreds of millions, or have hundreds of properties. It's not the US where everyone is invested in the stock market."

248,The thought and theory is just that... They will create their own steem like gaming platform that will have all of their merch for sale. If you want to download the game great they'll split the proceeds with the developer... You want to buy the physical disc great they  happily sell you the physical disc
249,"Just thought of another idea,  Let it fall tomorrow and be completely silent. Let the market decide what it wants to do. The next day (Dec 28) if it falls again, consider buying.  That's a win-win to me if I was playing calls.  A 2nd-day consecutive fall means you got cushioned on the 2nd fall.  A 2nd day rises means you just got cushioned from the original fall without risking further money."
250,APPL may need to partner with NIO for China operations if the CCP makes NIO a national EV Champion. I also think companies like LAZR will be acquired by APPL or another EV competitor because in the grand scheme of things a standalone Lidar equipment/software manufacturer doesn’t make sense - it will most likely be vertically integrated into an EV manufacturers supply chain. APPL literally just did this (vertically integrate) for its chips for the MacBooks by deciding to make its own. It could do the same thing for a company like LAZR if the tech proves to be superior with a legitimate IP position.
251,I'm a fucking gay bear....

284,"   ### 7. Will close-out purchases required by Regulation SHO drive up a security’s price?  Close-out purchases of stock will not necessarily drive up prices of such stocks. One of the primary purposes of Regulation SHO is to clean up open fail positions, but not to cause short squeezes. The term “short squeeze” refers to the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions as a result of sharp price increases or difficulty in borrowing the security the sellers are short. The rush by short sellers to cover produces additional upward pressure on the price of the stock, which then can cause an even greater squeeze. Although some short squeezes may occur naturally in the market, a scheme to manipulate the price or availability of stock in order to cause a short squeeze is illegal."

Leave it up to the government to never be on time right? lol Tryna do it right this time around.  NKLA S1 filed 6/15 but S1A was filed 7/1. EFFECT came on 7/17 so 16 days from S1A and 32 days from original S1.   QS S1 was filed 12/17 so I'm thinking earliest at 16 days is 1/2 which is saturday and we prob won't know that EFFECT has been filed until over the weekend which means gap down will be Monday and we won't get a chance for puts which is why I'm gonna throw some money at it on Friday maybe even Thursday if there is early sell off. Jan 8th exp for this play.  Latest is 32 days which 1/18 which is a Monday and I'm assuming it's gonna come over the weekend here as well into a gap down on Monday. Also need to keep an eye out for an S1A which would throw a wrench into the schedule. Jan 22nd exp for this one."

324,"China-Alibaba relations are of no concern to the US though.  This is China ""opening an antitrust"" with the result being a foregone and fixed conclusion already."
325,"Let’s talk about the psychology of recent events...  - anyone with half a brain knows that the EV market is killing it and there’s no sign of letting up. Apple sees there’s tremendous opportunity. With Steve Jobs passing, revolutionary ideas are lacking in Apple. Elon became the Steve Jobs of the EV market.  - Recent news about about how Cook refused to meet with Musk about buying Tesla in the past. Why would Musk do this. It’s like he’s rubbing it into to Cook about what could’ve been had he met so there’s got to be some sort of personal vendetta there.  How I see this playing out is Tesla intercepts Apple and brokers a deal with Magna. If you were Magna and both companies came at you, who would you team up with? Tesla is currently in EV. Apple is pursuing EV. Unless Apple offers some outrageous deal, I would go with Tesla.  Basically either way...MGA is well position. It’s like a kid with rich divorced parents fighting for the kids love!  MGA to the to 🌕 via SpaceX 🚀"
326,"When a stock price shoots up drastically from good news or crazy buying, short sellers get scared of the losses and buy to cover.  These compounding effects lead to a stupid-high price increase.  The bulls will be squeezing the shorts.  If you feel bad, wipe your tears with a Benjamin."

I've been diamond handing apple calls since a bit before September and I have zero fucking plans and I got into it because vibes. They're up now. 🤷‍♀️  If you have paper hands just stop. Stocks go up. Capitalism takes advantage of you, take advantage of it."
328,"Wow, so RIP baba calls. :("
329,So buy puts for both BABA and JD?    Read the whole thing but did not understand.
330,"OK, but you're just ""begging the question."" Why can't they buy 1 call option for 100 ps5s to cover their 100 ps5s sold short? Most options expire worthless and are not exercised so there exists more options shares than actual shares in the float, right?"
331,"The real DD is in the comments, 🐶 #WeWantCohen. GME!!!"
332,"Apple is not just another auto client. Existing OEM customers have their own factories and they use MGA to supplement manufacturing (I.e regions where they don’t have factories or they need to ramp up production to meet demand, etc)  Apple on the other hand, has not built factories for cars yet and chances are, they won’t for the foreseeable future. At least not until the sales volume justifies the capital investment and even then, Apple has historically focused on design and outsourced manufacturing. So Magna or any other manufacturer getting Apple business gets 100% of production similar to Magna’s deal with China’s BAIC Group"

342,what are you basing your min/max squeeze valuations on?
343,"Call me crazy but this bullish, it will be painful tho. You know what this means? BABA is huge like google Amazon huge in China. Ccp is mad because jack ma didn’t bow down and baba (probably) leaked reports about uyghur facial recognition which pissed them off.

353,Because they can't cover their positions with a call contract they'll still have to exercise the option which still requires buying the shares. You also can't buy 68milllion worth of shares through call. No entity can supply that.

367,I hold a ton of 2022 $300 BABA leaps. I did start cutting my losses and invested a portion in JD and SE 2022 leaps following the unexpected ANT IPO debacle. My position in BABA is pretty big (day 1 investor since its IPO in NYSE) and with Alicloud expected to turn profit by end of financial year (March 2021) I believed 2021 will be a breakout year with Alibaba becoming the first Chinese company with $1 Trillion valuation in NYSE based on Free cash flow estimates.  The short term headline risk with BABA is real and I hope Jack Ma would mend his relations with Chinese regulatory bodies.
368,Unless GME. Then you go all in and get yourself some sweet bankers money from Wells Fargo. I love Boomer money

374,"I held 10 x $120C 1/15/21 that I sold FOR A LOSS cause I read some ""analysis"" from some boomer fuck (not and autist here) that talked about how these big tech companies control their stock prices to ensure fucking over short position holders.  I bought into it and paper handed like a bitch."
375,I have 12/31/2020 21C's and 1/15/2021 20 C's. I bought them a few weeks ago and right after I bought I was down 99.99% on both essentially. I decided to hold because I wanted to stay true to my original thought process as to why I executed it. I turned out to be pleasantly surprised. If tomorrow we see GME $25+ I will be buying my wifes boyfriend new tires for his Ford Focus he has been wanting for a while now. $GME TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYS
376,Love your DD but you’re a dumb retarded inbred for posting this at 11pm
377,"FCEL is going to be a massive pump and dump. This fine gentlemen hit it right on the money.

384,"The one big wrong thing about this post is it kind of insinuates that 68m shares will have to cover or whatever. Only the ones that have failed to deliver would be. If you look at the fintel data it really isn't that many shares that have failed to deliver, someone correct me if I'm wrong but someone else who posts in these threads often has repeatedly pointed out that it really isn't that many shares that have failed to deliver. That being said...  IMO what happened last time was that Sherman decided to drop the MSFT news because GME had been on the SHO list fro 13 days. Maybe it was coincidence, but given the fact that they've been so tight lipped about what the partnership entails makes me think they had some motive for releasing that info - it'd be a painful day to need to cover a position if some bullish news came in that drove up stonk price.  I wouldn't yeet into anything at open, but this is definitely worth a bullet an hour or two into trading betting that Sherman does something again to pump up stonk price. He is incentivized to do so to make it more expensive for Cohen to buy voting power, and also it makes Sherman look better to shareholders should some sort of vote be put up"
385,"True, I wasn't intending my list to be a definite ""only these"" just pointing to some examples, and trying to make a joke.  May your stocks go to the Moon."
386,"It was because of the MSFT news, i mean trading got halted lol. But IMO sherman planned the news drop to be on the 13th SHO day. Not all shorts have to cover, just those that failed to deliver, which if you look at the fintel data really isn't that much. That being said it would be a painful day to be forced to find shares or cover if it happens when a big news item drops."
387,I hope that was all cash
388,"If anything sherman dropped the news because of the 13th day sho thing, but really the 13th day sho only forces shorts that have failed to deliver to either deliver or cover. It makes it painful for those shorts to have to do this on a day when news drops of course, but if you look at fintel data it really isn't that many shares shorted that have failed to deliver compared to the overall amount of shares shorted. I do think this is worth a play, and have been eyeing it myself, but it's not going to be THE SQUEEZE (probably). But if sherman drops some news I do think another 30+% is possible."
389,"You think GME can compete and even outplay AMZN? Hahahhahah. Pharma fears amazon. We are talking about video games... I understand gaming is a huge industry, but everyone at some point will use a pharmacy."
390,So baba puts?
391,yea if they drop some news it’ll go crazy
392,"Agreed, the way this position is actively managed makes me think shorts let price ride up, then sell weekly calls to idiots like us and then they drive price down. Long term this shit going up tho but weekly calls ain't it unless it's a quick day trade (IMO)"
393,"I've been thinking this and posting about this the last couple days. We'll find out tomorrow but yeah I thinkt here's a chance management released the news because it was on the 13th day. Not all shorts have to cover, just those that have failed to deliver, which if you look at fintel data really isn't that much. But again, it's a painful day to be forced to find shares to deliver or cover if it also happens when trading is halted and good bullish news comes out."
394,"None of this sounds lien terrible advice, so I’m ignoring it. Nice formatting, though. Maybe you would be really good a making memes on the side?  All jokes aside, I appreciate the post and will keep it in mind."
395,They only have to close the actual settlement failures though so this isn't really something that should trigger a massive short squeeze. If anything the only reason this will go up is that it's already going up anyway and now everyone on WSB will be buying calls lol
396,APPL pulling a China on China 😂😂😂
397,Let’s see that chart ex Elon

401,Is this going to be Apple TV all over again? I used to cover cable/telecom stocks and there were always rumours about how Apple was coming to disrupt TV and change the game and all they ended up doing was making half efforts in coming up with a watered down product
402,The short squeeze is a ridiculous fairy-tale and mathematically impossible
403,yeah but this time we have shares so we DGAF
404,I meant the puts are 10X. Look at principal and compare it to current market value on their GME puts. I could be reading it wrong 😑
405,All in GME? Got it
406,The question is what do we limit sell it as
407,So you say go long and then never hold through earnings? I'm confused
408,"I checked it myself. You're right about GME being on the list for 12 back-to-back days  [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)  Start from Dec 8 and set the market to NYSE.  The question is, does SEC really enforce it, or is it another joke regulation."
409,"starting a business from scratch is too much work, its easier to take over an established failing business on a practical sense.  look for takeover based on whale call option buying activity before february 22."
410,meh... Doug couldn't handle the Model3 ramp and got kicked after that.
411,Shhh dont tell the retards. This dude is gonna be trying to sue WSB in a few months claiming they made him lose his money on fucking PTON shares lol. What a dumb fucking stock
412,lol selling naked calls on a green day?  not good
413,"The point of hedging is to not lose capital. So hedge funds may have been doing things like buying puts to hedge their longs all year long, which isn't exactly free.  The idea is that once you're already very wealthy, you don't actually need to become super wealthier since that doesn't really serve any meaningful purpose to the vast majority of people."
414,Nah I bought day one with units. Last month the fomo started and died down. This is still a good play. But you can't just buy calls and have it double in a week so this post will probably be ignored.  Was surprised at the prices of the June spreads.
415,So QS is basically the NKLA of the battery world? Gotta love how pre revenue companies are Somehow worth hundreds of millions lol. What a time to be alive.
416,"I think it makes a lot more sense for Apple, a computer company who's already built a bunch of their own chips, to get involved with the self driving side of things. Producing chips like Mobileye does would actually make some sense.  It makes no sense at all that Apple would actually construct their own cars, they don't even fucking construct their own iPhones and farm it all out to Foxconn and Wistron and Pegatron."

426,"Yeah 0.5% of outstanding shares is only like 350K shares, but that's only what's needed to be put on that list. We aren't really sure what % is actually failing to deliver. There are more shares short than total float. (Shortsqueeze is showing 67.98M shares short.) Also,  it could cause a chain reaction plus it's getting to the end of the year so some might cover more and eat the losses for taxes. We shall see how it goes. I'm gonna be jumping as early as possible but ready to bounce at a moment's notice lol"
427,"Except that it costs nothing to hold shares, especially on a stock with a solid value play"
428,"I've got a bit over $300k of GME shares/calls currently, and another nice chunk of cash idle. Up from ~$50k at the nadir earlier this year."

430,No way it’s dropping under $24 anymore
431,Right? I thought I missed something while staring at the chart all day. Heart almost fell through my asshole
432,They dont need him for a model 3 ramp up tho. Anyone expecting them to compete with tesla in 2024 is also dreaming. What they have a fair shot at is edging into the market and producing something that can compete with the brand name auto makers that are shifting into EV.
433,"Lol why interest rates are almost nothing right now, you would be better off just dropping it in an index and making payments."
434,8+% now. Ugh.
435,Tbh those companies won't get bought out. Just like the GoPro you'll find lidars become cheap asf and plentiful in the next two years
436,"The BATs are not immune though. They are doing this out in the open exactly because negotiations in the backrooms broke down.  If Alibaba, and especially Ma, try to keep fighting then I see no reason why China shouldn't just say fuck it. Especially since these big companies growing at their current pace are a giant problem to the power structure. Theyd rather have ten big companies instead of 3 large ones."
437,Games with disks have to be installed too and use the same amount of HD space.
438,"When the news is out that Ryan increased position from 10% to 13%, the possibility of short squeeze increased to 90%. Selling covered Calls after that news is wrong.  **If a stock has a slim chance of short squeeze, don't sell covered calls.**   **If there is a good chance of short squeeze, DON'T SELL COVERED CALLS.**   In June 2019 people sold TSLA covered LEAP calls for pennies. Now those calls worth millions. I know this from positive first hand experience.  Having said that, you might end up collecting $2k for free. That doesn't mean selling CC was the right move."

If the market had just woken up a week earlier I’d be retired, instead I ended up with most of the losses as everyone else. (I got back in fairly quickly.)  So when are you going to act? Everyday the news tells you the sky is falling. When you see the sky falling and the market doesn’t, Will you believe it?"
479,I'd love to get in but 130% IV says no. Hope you win tho 🚀🚀🚀
480,"Cohen is not incentivized to drive up price coz he wants to get more voting shares, maybe. he stopped right at 9001000 which is some dragon ball z reference so maybe he doesn't want any more shares. assuming he does want more shares he's not going to be too vocal until he's done acquiring.  Sherman, however, is incentivized to drive this stonk up to make it harder for cohen to acquire shares, and also to make it look like this board is competent since their stonk is going up"
481,"Okay now that I think about it, I think it did shoot up 12%, then being halted before going up 25%+"

487,"Don't put too much weight on this theory, the amount of shares that will have to be covered tomorrow are a drop in the bucket, they may push the price up a few tens of a cent, but I doubt we see a 40% day.  I'm long as fuck on GME and I think this is a multibagger play, but give it some time, you don't double your money overnight, unless you luck out with some retarded FD or whatever..."
488,Wait... so does this mean 🚀? ELI5...
489,That's their own dumb-ass fault for investing in something because it's located geographically near to them. Doesn't mean other people can't make money off the stock
490,You made many people salary in a day lol
491,Chewy guy literally did it so wtf is wrong with u. he literally took on amazon and petco and won
492,"RC buying more might be the actual catalyst. Someone has been buying a ton of shares this week, I suspect it's him expanding his position, just like he did last week."
493,It's a pyramid scheme
494,I have shares since 22. Will sleep on it
495,This regulation is no joke. Squeeze or not. There are huge penalties at stake if they don't cover.
496,"Any analyst that claims high certainty with near term shit is a shill. But EOY I’d point toward mid/high $20s, and we retrace to this level or lower after management’s ICR &amp; holiday sales report (Jan 13th &amp; 12th), but that dip will, like they all have been by this activist &amp; theirs, bought."
497,"I have some calls and stocks I’m selling mid January, some AAPL &amp; MSFT 2/19 calls I’ll sell by 1/29 for earnings. Other stocks - NIO TSLA SQ MP sell in January to avoid 2020 taxes. Start of Feb buy some April and May VIX 30calls and just wait a month or two. I’m ok missing the last 5% of the top as long as I’m out and hedged for the 10-15% correction. I made triple digit ROI this year. I can walk away now happy and miss a little of the frothy top. Unlike sex I’m pulling out slowly"
498,I was planning on day trading them and they were up 30% at one point but it sold off and never recovered. I held too long cuz I had a looser stop loss since the market has been full retard bull mode for the past 2 weeks.
499,"borrowdesk only tracks Interactive Brokers, it doesn't have Robinhood, Schwab, Fidelity or any other broker's data..."
500,Eh. If I want to play Apple EV why don’t I just buy AAPL?  AAPL has so much more that could keep the stock moving besides cars that I think it outperforms MGA. And then if the car is a flop again Apple has different runaways to keep the stock up whereas MGA would take a nosedive.   I’m out.
501,If there’s a squeeze I’m buying more
502,"I have a small, less than 5% position in BABA in my retirement account.  While this is obviously not good news, I am a long term holder and I’ll probably pick a bit more up after it crashes in the US market.   In the long run, this is still going to be a good growth stock."
503,"Are you all worried?,"
504,"ahminus is right, it only tracks one broker and it is definitely no longer useful to gauge short activity."
505,So true
506,Why wouldn't he just buy more shares when it was $15 if that's what he wanted? Why does he need more shares? Doesn't he already have enough that even if they go through with the dilution they mentioned in their earnings report he'd still be above 10%?   I think Cohen wants the stock to improve. He doesn't have any incentive to drive it down?
507,"A good short should be owned for 5-10 minutes and be sold as soon as soon as it has a profit spike.  That's worked for me after huge green days on aapl, f, and INTC this year"
508,"good luck, I was prepared for this to dip TODAY, but it went 12%+ at some point, before being pushed down to 6% buy those sleazy put buyers. I think this might actually moon tomorrow again, especially if Cohen reveals more share buying this week."
509,I kept screwing up with FCEl. Everytime I buy PUTs it goes up and Calls it goes down. I inverse myself I still lose money.
510,also cohen is aware of this date himself hence why he magically started buying last week.  hes aware people look at his positional changes thats why its important to look for dates like these because insiders while time things around them.  october 8th msft announcement was timed around the same thing.
511,"Yep. That’s what he’s proposing. Not sure the current board would go this route. Cohen might. But judging by chewy he really likes a sharp focus. To me GameStop should only do gaming related hardware. So TVs, soundbar, headphones, etc and draw the line at allowing anything else"
512,"Oh man, hope it works out for you"
513,it is a hell of a lot faster to install a game from disc than to download it
514,"They are the Chinese amazon, but there's always the risk of investing in chinese companies, that's about the only risk lol. (For baba anyways) keep your position moderately small, I have 50 shares in a 200k account, and buy the dip? Down from $300 seems pretty good to me lol."
515,"We're already squeezing, it's just a slow burn and not a Mach 11 launch into the stratosphere like everybody here thinks it was supposed to be. Not all squeezes are fast, some take weeks, months to unwind (TSLA)"
516,U realize him buying drives up share price and that he’s probably got a trading desk putting in these orders for him to maximize stonk per dollar right. U also realize his last 500k came at 16 right. Coz he had no more time before filing ammended 13D so he couldnt wait for share price to fall
517,This guy is an idiot lol all his “qualifications” for making his play are based on TA BS and the only people not making money in this market are weirdos like this
518,"Good man, welcome to the space elevator.  We are still in preboarding and will be departing soon.

524,Yeah he assumes the price shot up like it did without that being shorts covering. It clearly was a short squeeze.
525,"Apple has also a good relationship with LG - they use LG to source LED screens.  No reason they wouldn’t source LG parts for a car too.    So basically, LG has MGA manufacturer EV parts.  AAPL orders LG parts, therefore MGA’s volume triples in 5 years."
526,"It's not going to dip tomorrow. Just throw 30k at open if you're going to do it because there is a very real chance that the squeeze will happen tomorrow and if you aren't in the moment the market opens, you'll miss it. Not saying that the squeeze is totally for sure going to happen tomorrow, but it's probably the most likely day we've had for it to start so far."

Spoiling your kids won’t make them better off either. Happiness is a choice, teach them that. The people making millions are either lucky or doing things you wouldn’t be willing to do."

542,Doesn't matter..gamblers made millions on those..I wish I wasn't a pussy..or was retarded with just half a brain working willing to take huge risks
543,I think so as well. Earnings will be good and I think dust will settle in January. A lot of funds and institutions own Baba and they aren’t gonna make it drop. This is all politics show at the moment. Weekly calls are fucked but I think 3+ months out are fine
544,When do we sell? What are your gtfo for real signs?

The dust will settle in January and the run back to 300 will begin. I plan to just chill and come back in a month and re-evaluate. I plan on selling at break even but should be fine. Lesson learned don’t touch Chinese stocks for options, buy stock  There is also sketchiness"
547,You didn’t?
548,You realize you can lose your shirt your pants and your fuckin car with shares too right? You know these retards are on margin.

553,"I do not trust someone who thinks they're smart either picking stocks, thanks. Retards are at least honest about how fucking stupid they are."
554,Not a chance.
555,PM as in premarket hahaha not am pm
556,"That's a terrible answer though. It's written like some kind of legalese CYA non-answer. I feel like it's only in there because the SEC can't openly admit that this regulation absolutely can impact the market, even though that isn't the intent of it.  It's not even a ""no"", they just say ""not necessarily"". Then they give absolutely no explanation or justification as to why a close out purchase wouldn't drive up the price of a stock other than ""cuz that would be illegal!"". Supply and demand doesn't suddenly stop existing just because the SEC said so.  Close out purchases might not have a \*significant\* effect on the price of a stock, depending on the size of the fail to deliver position being closed and the market conditions of that day.  But closing out a short-position by buying shares is going to put at least some degree of buying pressure on the market whether it was a mandated close out or not."
557,Then what the fuck is the point of hedge? Even if we get a bear market now and made more then they did in 5 years
558,I think I saw those were 20 and 22? Is there any scenario where they're forced to close early?
559,"To me, the right move is all in Tesla and hold for 10 years."
560,"Impossible, everyone yelled dead cat bounce in March. No one called the bottom, no one."
561,I have no doubt BABA has extensive monopolistic behavior. I'm surprised the government decides to do something about it.
562,They could lose and we moon. I’m just noting there are a lot of players in this game with barring priorities
563,Gme barely has 68 million shares outstanding. How could there be that many shares shorted?
564,Had a friend who worked with wet cells - big gigantic ones.  Lots of innovation in battery tech.  I say fuck it let’s jump right to the Perpetual motion machine...
565,AAPL LEAPs is the way
566,Why pltr no moon? Why it only here ? Go to moon
567,They need to create the meme stock 100 etf and give it the ticker RTRD. That would've saved you a lot of time
568,"Too much reading, all I read was GME short squeeze tomorrow. Tendiesssss 🚀"
569,AMAZON HAS SO MANY MORE THAN 175 warehouses LMAO
570,"The short answer is:  So hedge funds make money.   The long answer is:   Hedge funds make money charging management fees.   Clients pay management fees.   It’s easier to explain why you underperformed against S&amp;P500 by 8% than show a 8% loss. Even tho mathematically it’s same.   Clients are prone to emotional swings, so they don’t see Penny less earned == Penny lost.   Clients contribute to AUM   If clients are unhappy they leave hedge funds.   Hedge funds make money based on AUM."
571,This lowkey seems illegal but I’m not a lawyer lmao
572,Rise Your PT setpoints it's going higher than that
573,Yep 25c. If it runs to 25 I’ll make 5k on 300$ 25k if it runs to 30.
574,Recently Jack Ma openly slapped the faces of top Chinese officials. That got some top guys really angry. That's why Ant IPO was canceled.
575,Isn't it basically when countries stop buying american debt? Also [this](https://brrr.money/)
576,"You're still very much alive on those. It's possible that this post is correct and the squeeze does initiate tomorrow, in which case those things will be a gold mine. It's also possible that even without a squeeze, the price will pump a little immediately at open and give you a brief window where you can dump those for around break even.  Personally what I would do is pray for a strong open and try to get rid of those about 5-10 minutes after open, and then immediately take that money and buy new contracts with a later expiration date."
577,Anyone who bought calls on the 21'st is already up over 100% lol it's been 2 days.
578,"Apple is basically collaborating with NIO  in order to kick start their EV project. Apple has a history of collaborating with other companies. At this point, Apple doesn't have shit besides their overheating laptops and overpriced iphones with Samsung parts. One thing Apple is good at is outsourcing shit to China. I think NIO will come out as a bigger winner and this will help them bolster their brand even more. I'm also a bit more bias towards NIO since I'm balls deep."
579,"Yeah I helped your dad tell them about you.  But fr, if you can't time your puts don't lose money buying them. Otherwise make those gains in record time, yes."
580,Does he make announcements during a certain time? Where would I see this info?
581,"I think the question is ""are they going to solo it or are they contracting/buying NIO?""  And a lot of the answers I've seen in this sub have been ""Buy PLTR and GME"""
582,"I understand the general concept of a squeeze - people who've shorted need to purchase the stock and cut their losses, driving the price up. But could someone please ELIR(etarded)?"
583,"Ah, so basically to avoid a sizable retrace, GME needs ridiculous momentum by the mid-January point"
584,"You're a ridiculous furry fucker and your brain is mathematically retarded.     If you said the mega-squeeze is very unlikely, I'd agree, but when you start claiming something categorically, I know you're an idiot."
585,"Could also play the Buffett Diamond hand for life strategy.   Pick any 2 date points on S&amp;P500 15 years apart and try and show a loss, it’s not possible.   Of course a black swan event can happen...   But so can a meteor , super volcano, or zombie apocalypse. And catering a majority strategy to build a super bunk sounds retarded; just as a super conservative financial strat."
586,No information but I guarantee there will be a lottery.  Probably have a minimum turnover or something to qualify. That might break an SEC rule or something though.
587,Uhhhh no. They’re for growth not asset protection lol.
588,"To be fair, amzn got burnt on that one as well - fire tv. I think that was to do with lack of secular trend for the segment. Anyway, With that kind of balance sheet theres no way around chasing elephants. Transports as a service is probably the biggest out there currently, and within their reach. So it makes sense to me."
589,"People who become Jeff Bezos and Musk didn’t seek out to become richest person.   Just like the person commenting “oh if I had 3mil at 25 I’d just live off dividends !” - irony is that mentally is exactly what prevents anyone from age of 20 hitting 3mil. If you’re not taking risk with money you’re doing so with a business, a career choice, or regular lottos."
590,"Ok I might be retarded but I am NOT a furry. I've ran the numbers, its not gonna happen coz no one has confidence in this shit stock, call it blockbuster 2, its a pyramid scheme and /u/deepfuckingvalue at the top of pyramid and played you all like fiddle, it will crash like titanic, so get in and out real quick at your own risk but safer to just avoid it"
591,"I'm fucking annoyed I dont have more money to breed money with. I've got 60 percent returns.... on a three thousand dollar investment.  If that shit were 40k investment, I'd have 60k. I'd have made actual money.   Fucking annoying. I have to 10x just to make it to the starting line. Fucking fuck.   I'm really damn hopeful for the pandemic end, though. Around March I should be able to build out a new business that's been on hold, and make a bunch of fucking money to feed to the money printing machine. Little late for the real GME squeeze - I've got 300 and am hoping for a red day tomorrow to buy another 400 or so, though, so. I'm putting my lunch money in the rocket machine! After I buy another MT call tomorrow.    Red Christmas Eve, pretty please? Freak out about the stimmy bill or whatever, c mon. If you can also get me my 3 Tesla shares, I'd be thrilled."
592,Higher the price the lower the negative EPS.  Makes sense.  Losses per share are bad;  only way to decrease them is to moon the stock 😆.
593,20 shares and 4/16/2021 $35call reporting for duty! Gonna buy more calls mañana. It’s on
594,That a boy
595,"Just from charting the past support and resistance lines, it's been steadily punching through and back-testing, realistically by June-July 2021 if it's a slow burn as the shorts cover, potentially faster. I think 25 by end of year at least."
596,"Yeah, those are pretty safe, will easily print. These other options are just for the impatient."
597,"Ayyyy, glad to have you onboard, all the dips are just discounts on the way!"

641,"FCEL has been a ride - I bought before the share offering, stuck with it, DCA’d in, and now feel a bit vindicated. 1000 shares only, no calls."
642,"Buying the $30c gives you 100 shares at $30. Selling the  $35c means you owe someone 100 shares at $35.  So, if the price exceeds $35, you make the money from 30 to 35, but after that your shares are sold. But, if it never hits $30, you still pocket the profits from selling the $35c. So, it limits your risk (and reward). Basically, the ideal scenario is price hitting $34.99, so you pocket the $35c profit and get good returns from your $30c."
643,"There’s no way this stock is worth 2x what DKNG is worth. No way.   Penn is in like one god damn state so far, right?"
644,This looks really fucking familiar. Can’t place my finger on it.
645,"I am still waiting for apha to ""get high"". I did buy at the top @ $8.40. I'll wair for a year."
646,PLTR is ass.   Edit: Downvoting me is not going to change the fact that your $33 Calls will never regain the same value when you bought them at 150 IV a month ago.
647,BFT for now but even after ticker change going to be BFT (Big Fucking Tendies)
648,That was such a shitty take. The least valuable part of PENN is their brick and mortar casinos lmao
649,"dont be a pussy, why would u do spreads? its going to only go up"
650,"ya it’s a saturated online betting market. DraftKings, FanDuel, mgm, etc. profitability is low for all of these because of all the comps and marketing they have to do."
651,Every one in WSB likes to eat ass. So this is absolute win!
652,"It’s all about waiting for the market to ‘get high’ lmao   And I feel you, I threw 100 buck at it when it was at 8.32 and managed to sell at 8.47 before it dropped again. I’d say just sit on em and hope Trump doesn’t cross the Rubicon or some shit"
653,I don’t get it. Where are the options? What’s a “share”?
654,I knew a guy in high school named Robert. He was retarded just like you. Y'all would get along.   PLTR to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
655,"I hate to come across as the voice of reason, but has anyone on wsb thought about selling options instead of buying them.  You know, slow and steady winning the race, that sorta thing."
656,"I got a few leaps on the works, once they start showing some returns, I'm 100% pltr afterwards."
657,"Really? I have a RH account but decided to be a big boi and went with ToS and Schwab just like one of the boomers, it's my disguise."
658,A prime example of if you would have just invested in SPY you'd have been better off lol but god bless the heart of a true autist
659,I don’t care about your marriage to your high school sweetheart.
660,"Cooool, a fellow Canadian!"
661,"SPACs have had a bad name for a long time, but times are changing. Good companies are going the SPAC route to avoid unpredictable stock prices, losing company control and paying heavy fees. Paysafe is a great example of this."
662,Didn’t know they had a stock. That’s a bet. Grow Genration and Aphria got my heart rn
663,I bought shares around 12. Might sell a couple
664,Debt isn’t a big deal since their Sportsbook app will be rolled out into every legal state by the end of 2021 so debt shouldn’t be a concern.
665,It’ll be rolled out in every legal state by end of 2021. And look at their numbers in their one state so far their numbers are insane
666,You stole someone's picture from a couple hours ago to gain karma? Ban this shill.
667,"My stock is TLRY mate, they IPO’d like two years ago   They still red but I bought before a minor dip so that’s mainly on me lol"
668,When did you buy? Some other guy on this thread told me he bought at the 8.40 peak lmao
669,"Around $8.7, I'm pretty retarded but I'll hold these heavy bags and maybe ome day turn a profit."
670,"Just when I think you couldn’t possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this…...... and totally redeem yourself! I'M IN!"
671,"Shit man, and here I thought I screwed up with the TLRY bet haha  Don’t really know what to tell you, I’m too new to this so I’d just sit on the stock and hope for the merger and the US market to make this thing go to the moon"
672,Show us the all time. You can't say you used to be a 🌈🐻 without showing us how big of a 🌈🐻 you were.
673,"I assume you mean every state where sports gambling is legal. They will have the barstool crowd for sure. But, they are currently not in the top 3 for sports betting apps in the US. I’m not saying it’s not going to be profitable but I am saying that currently or anytime in the next few years this is not worth double DraftKings. It’s pure hype and it is going to plummet eventually unless the stoolies just refuse to sell"
674,"Oh yeah I got it know, dw we’re all equally retarded here lmao"
675,Now YOLO calls on PLTR. This is the way
676,Not if you have a big stack.
677,"yup, highers lows a good sign"
678,"You're banking on: 1. The democrats winning the senate 2. That cucknadian weed companies compete with american companies. With subzidies, tolls and other costs that might not be the case long term.  I read the same DD about a month ago and picked up som APHA (terrible timing on my part). My stocks have been slowly bleeding out, so I'm a lot more sceptical about this play than I was a month ago. I'll hold my position and see how this plays out, but I'm not buying any more. High risk high reward, although the chance to earn some serious money is looking quite slim atm."
679,"If you do go 0DTE, remember that tomorrow is a half day"
680,There are actually a lot of solid non EV SPACs right now.   There are also a lot of really shitty EV SPACs right now.
681,"This stocks +100 easy tendies just buy shares and sell cc, wouldn’t buy weeklies rn thou"
682,I buy mostly spacs around NAV but lets be real most companies are still shit and or overhyped
683,If only it wasn't 3k a share...
684,Yeah pretty much lol   Although I don’t really need a blue Senate since there’s the small possibility of both parties reaching a compromise (not likely)   And many states are legalizing weed on a state level already (+Biden seems to be pushing for a more free trade-like policy) so at least I would expect the snow Mexicans to get some money out of the American market even if just for next year. Only time will tell I guess so good luck mate!
685,OTM leaps isnt a bad idea.
686,Care to guess at percentage increase? My gut tells me sub 1%...Amazon stock hasn’t done much over last few months
687,I want bft but it needs options
688,It will be roughly 6-9%. You may have your window tomorrow 😜
689,use that money for a real phone carrier
690,"BFT stands for Big Fuggin Titties. Go all in guys, it literally cannot go tits up."
691,"Buy a fractional share, retard"

693,"Blended average is 3.6%. Could roll with that assuming closes tomorrow around $3,160 you could buy a Dec 31st call on RH right now for $3,270 strike price for a nice cheap.... $1500/contract."
694,My calls would appreciate a meager 25% pop in share price.
695,That premium and breakeven are going to fuck you
696,What does that have to do with existing debt? They have $12 billion in debt. That doesn’t go away because of new states for their app
697,Always has been
698,Yes it does lol. Expansion = revenue and PENN spends way less on advertising than the competitors. Their business model is scalable and profitable. So that’s why the debt doesn’t really matter
699,Not in the top 3 because they’re only in PA. Look at their numbers so far in PA. If you don’t see the long term value then idc haha
700,"I’ve done research but I still don’t understand exactly what their software does , I’m still gonna yolo because I’m retarded but I’d like help understanding why."
701,Anybody know some weed stocks that are on revolut?
702,"Green Thumb Industries and Cresco Labs are the stocks to be in you fucking retards. 1B in revenue next year, 50%+ margins, with 400-500% revenue growth ahead. Canadian LP’s are trash."
703,He bought at crazy high IV so he's gonna get IV crushed unless PLTR goes way above $30
704,I hope so. The stock hasn’t been too exciting the past few months but I don’t want to sell until I’ve held 12+ months so it would be nice to see a little sumfin sumfin.
705,Day after Xmas would be Saturday so you really think it will close higher Monday?
706,"Lol, that IV premium doe. See theta is gonna eat your lunch and IV is gonna fuck your asshole with no lube.   Let's play a game where it is near expiry and the stock hits 30.  Your contracts are worth $1.  You paid $5.10."
707,Alright so idk what to do with this information or if it's even relevant but hypothetically speaking someone close to me works for a medical marijuana company and they're moving to Georgia middle of next year. Also their company trades otc.
708,"call his carrier and do it for him, lol free robinhood account"
709,"No that’s not $200, it’s $110 and it’s right there in the chart in the previous two years it increased $130 and then about $80. Just adjust accordingly. If you’re thinking it’s closer to a 1.5% average increase like in 2015-2018 great go for it. I would argue this has been a stronger year for Amazon than ever before. (They’re stock is up 77% YoY)."
710,When you see a fat number of shares not being sold/bought to drive up shit until they decide to let loose.
711,wtf is wrong with you guys? Y'all acting like SPCE didn't happen.
712,i sold everything in april/may and sat on the sidelines waiting for the crash. all time is up 160%
713,You got some DD on those?
714,...Fuck it I’m in  🚀🚀🚀
715,I talked with guy from bank who wants to make interview with me for a job. He said that he YOLO'd Palantir and expects it to reach $50. That's the spirit.
716,March expiration? You good. These 15 year olds using their moms account don’t know what they talking about. Pltr gonna moon bro
717,"Most of the big moves happened during the trading day the past two years, compared to a big gap up overnight. You are better off with a wait n see strategy— if it bursts out of the gate at the open on Monday just day trade a weekly. Better risk reward than holding a weekly or monthly over the weekend.  Two cents."
718,"Didn’t know Georgia had medical marijuana tbh but all in all, if it’s a small company it may be a signal of a growth in the weed sector   Have they IPO’d yet?"
719,"Stop trying to make PLTR happen,  it's not going to happen.  Take your stock shilling elsewhere."
720,"I have 50 shares, you can say I am a big investor"
721,"Keep Yolo’ing, no one except PLTR knows what their software does.  That’s the point, sell hopes and dreams to government agencies around the world and show them the data.   Those agencies don’t care how it works, if it gives them intel on what they want, then they’ll continue to dump money into that software.   Remember, government agencies aren’t like corporations, they’ll hold onto something until it’s on its last legs. Same with hospitals.   This is going to make money for years to come."
722,Every time you buy a call option you have to be able to lose all of it so let that hoe die
723,"What the fuck, he was like the only mod who chats all the time, the other one spends all his time in politics or news lol. All the others are just old as shit who never do anything visible"
724,"If you take the first four letters in the Palantir ticker and count those up you get a grand total of 4 letters. You divide this by two because half of the stock owners are filthy shorters, and then because you have gone a full loop you are left with two o’s. Since the PLTR stock is related to black magic you add the m in front of the already derived o’s. Finally since PLTR EOY price is infinite you derive the n from ‘never ending gains’. Added together this spells ‘moon’. Coincidence? All research; financial and news reports OBVIOUSLY report palantir will indeed go to the moon 🚀🚀. There’s no denying it at this point bois, the definitive evidence has arrived!!"
725,"Its technically low thc oil currently but its for the grow and manufacture so, basically same thing. Im gonna shoot you their stock profile via pm."
726,"All stocks are basically up for the year, but what proof do we have that this year will be better"
727,Another 🌈🐻 becomes a retard
728,Perhaps the only mod that wasn’t gay..
729,Why didn’t you get out yesterday? Must have been looking at least salvageable then.
730,"You are, what, maybe 3% out of the money with your call option?  With over a week to go, price fluctuation of aapl will be more than that.  I say you have a good chance on seeing your money back. Hold steady."
731,Last week of December or the first week of January Apple releases the insane amount of money people spent in the Apple App store on Christmas morning and every year it is record-breaking.
732,"I swing trade a share of AMZN all the time, it rarely dips below 3k then you just wait for it to go to 3200 or so and it a free easy profit.   Just bought 3 shares bc of this post let’s go"
733,"Get that trash outta here, pltr is so 2 days ago"
734,"This guy's actually correct, these are two good MSOS  that you should research. Not Canadian companies and acquisitions. There's two ETFS as well MSOS and YOLO if you don't want to DD yourself as hard or use the ETFs as a research starting point."
735,Y’all retards should be buying options on MSOS. It’s basically the US Weed ETF.  Canada is old news and the companies are still bleeding money there.   The MSOS ETF invests a majority of funds in the big 4 US Multi State Operators (MSOs).   This ETF will continue to rocket as more states legal sales start and with every piece of good news as we crawl towards us legalization. MSOS has only been around a few months now but look at the AUM growth each month to get a sense of how fast this will grow.   LEGAL WEED IS COMING TO THE US.    You wanna make money as we ride this rocket ship or not. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
736,"It is currently happening though. Returns day to day like this are very rare. And it’s holding up for time, not just dumping."
737,You’re are still welcomed with open arms.
738,"Omg the 🌈 🐻 are turning. That's it, we're fucked. Market crash inbound."
739,3% down aapl confirmed
740,"If it landed on Black 5 times in a row, I wouldn't bet on Black again. This is gambling, so this ""rule"" should apply."
741,"I got some $9c 1/15 early and they’ve really been putting in some work. Also got some shares at $15, but not sure what next. Might just keep grabbing shares and selling puts for a little. Calls pretty expensive right now"
742,It is Q1
743,Please understand there was a huge sell off at the end of the market today. Things are going back up tomorrow or after Christmas not a financial adviser btw.
744,I followed it I think. Have the same ones lol got 10x $7 2022 calls for 1.84 each. I’m holding a year. Sold one to free ride it. Fuck it
745,Dude! I just looked through your profile! You don't miss! Great job!  Edit: BRUH WHAT?? Your calls are on point! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?
746,All i did was point to past numbers and the trend. Pulling the levers is on you.
747,Holy shit 12 billion are you serious?
748,After my experience with aurora cannabis I’m not touching weed stocks. Most of them are pump and dump garbage.
749,"Reposting this answer I gave someone else. It's not all inclusive but it's a good representation of their value.   Others have pointed out their business model, I'll try to address your specific question regarding industry advantage.  They build an OS that provides data ""plumbing"".  Your 50 year old businessis using a Frankenstein hodgepodge of various data management systems? Some in SAP, SQL, cloud, old excel files, custom industry specific software, legacy enterprises, and other disparate sources? No problem, PLTR OS will unify that data cohesively, without jepordizing the integrity of that data by migrating or converting it.  Moving and interpreting data is expensive, time consuming, tedious and risky.   PLTR is, currently, offering a much better approach to solving that issue than its competitors. At least for very large companies that have gone through two or more decades of tech upgrade cycles."
750,"God i lost so much money on Dec18 $9 and $11 calls on fcel, initially back in November they were up like crazy so i had more than a month to go and i was loving it, but of course Dec 18 is approaching and they shorted the shit out of all those outstanding contracts to expire what a sweep"
751,No you don't you would've lost so much money on fcel calls read my post above
752,"Let me guess, as a true WSB autist you bought it at 11am yesterday when aapl popped? Now you’re bag holding   Well relax young puppy, you still got a week."
753,No all time? Ban.
754,You are not... tough luck with the S&amp;P add but still plenty of time to turn it around
755,"I think I read about that ETF, I’ll look it up a bit and prob stick some money in there before New Years"
756,Well yeah. But what happened new?
757,"Stateside cannabis investors is a good jumping off point: https://www.statesidecannabisinvestors.com  I’ve been in weedstocks since 2016, so I could do this all day, but essentially, the top tier MSO’s (multi state operators) have completely different fundamentals than Canadian LP’s. Strong margins, huge revenue growth, profitable, low debt, great management teams, federal moat, operating in a tiny fraction of where they will be in 5 years. On top of that institutions can’t buy them due to federal law, hence why they aren’t listed on major exchanges — the Biden administration likely changes that dynamic. You have federal law preventing institutional investors from getting into an industry that will do roughly 100% annual growth rates in revenue in the USA alone, with roughly 15B of market cap currently for An industry projected to do 50B in the USA in 5 years."
758,"Loli have 3 of this one , waiting for my jan calls so i can finally start making bigger investments"
759,You didn’t YOLO hard enough sorry bro
760,Yall forget Winnie is a bear?
761,BRB gonna take out a mortgage and put it all on Tesla calls...
762,"Thanks, I have had a good run picking names in the past two months (I'm sure others have too in this small cap bull run) I keep waiting for it to fall apart"
763,"Nice, I tried pulling the trigger on 10x but didn't have funds available at the time"
764,"It's only 99% of portfolio, I still got my 1%"
765,"I bought 878 shares, I think that it still has room to grow. It's growth yoy looks good to me too."
766,"Lol the drop of JD is stupid. It should rise instead. The investigation on BABA’s monopoly action is on their “1 of 2” policy for the merchants, which means the merchants can only choose BABA or JD (or PDD). And JD and PDD have been against this policy for a long time. If BABA is judged as monopoly, JD will benefit from this."
767,Stop thinking so hard retard
768,"ouch, almost got in today. what's the dip going to look like? biden doesn't like china... puts??"
769,Most of us have shares and should be buying calls with play money. I’m selling calls making good money from PLTR. It’s not to late to grab a 100 shares
770,"Yo retards and autists, those of you who callS Baba read this. Supreme leader is after Jack Ma ass. Supreme leader is holding Ma’s balls tightly, squeezing his balls on and off"
771,"Wait for Feb plebs, that stock dump baggage has to be shed"
772,"I'm in at $30 before corona.  Wish I wouldve quadrupled down when it was at $4, but i didn't.  I did have a 01/15/21 $10C that I sold for 100% profit a while ago that i still cry over."
773,I'm trying to be so retarded. 12/31 $35c 12/31 $25c 1/15/21 $30c
774,"Dam boys need to learn a lot more. Don't buy shit that's over 100% IV at the time, unless you're talking qs tsla ai because no way they're ever below but yeah don't pay more than $2 for contracts in the beginning"
775,....and this just happened https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-24/china-probes-alibaba-group-on-suspected-monopoly-kj24j5cu  My 1/15 300 calls were always screwed but hey... why not rub it in
776,"Also, big institution money flowing into Baba. Must be a bright side is retards aren’t seeing."
777,"I’ll make sure to check those out then, for now I gotta wait for TLRY to go up a bit before I drop it lol   Here’s hoping Biden’s admin will enable weed related sales to go through banks as well"
778,"I was downvoted months ago for warning that anything related to Ma is risky due to his political exposure.  In general, don't touch mainland stocks because rampant fraud/lax regulation.  Moreso, don't touch mainland stocks when the figurehead is a Chinese celebrity because their fortunes change rapidly at any minor political mis-step.  Then again, this place is a casino so I guess that makes these perfect trading opportunities?"
779,"This is why I always stay away from all and any Chinese companies. The CCP, a authoritarian government is bad for business. Also financial rule of law doesn’t apply to them. They can easily make shit up."
780,"Nah my first my time dipping my toe into investing I lost big on this and some others. Well, not “big” now I made $1200 in 12 hours this week, but back then $1000 was a big deal."
781,Big question is Ma still alive!? He has been fucking quiet and low since Ant squashed by Supreme leader.
782,If youre so confident why is portfolio diversity below 98%?
783,Shit. Got 20k in BABA 2022 LEAPS. Should've take my 120% profit when it hit $320 two months ago. Got greedy and probably might face CCP's wrath.
784,You’re so stupid
785,"I agree we need to figure out what the short counterparty strategy is here coz it does not seem like a winning one.   But god damn its well over 100k put contracts Jan 15, fucking 20% of the float. Ur right this is gonna change the gamma calc but i think more than anything this is to change the delta hedging for the market maker, which in turn stops the gamma squeeze. The thing is this is just kicking the can down the road coz as these hedges expire vanna flows r gonna be powerful af and skyrocket this shit"
786,This. Stonk goes up. We got papa cohen buying up the company but taking his time so shorts can flounder around and give him prime pricing as we all ascend. We may also see his amended 13d tmrw showing he was the driver of Tuesdays buying. I suspect he buys big again tmrw to let the news of his expanding sharehold and a new 52 week high hit and linger over the long weekend.
787,"Well shit, I’d be traumatized too if I lost a grand lmao, I’m just a 200 bucks investor😂  Overall, weed stocks haven’t been bad for me but I’m down 15 bucks just because of TLRY and it feels bad man"
788,"Don't let these long term retards blind you, this is the way."
789,You’re not even retarded. You’re stupid. You don’t belong here.
790,man so many downvotes for a guy taking precautions haha
791,"Nooooo, Baba black sheep, Baba being eaten by Winnie. Ma why ma? You no suckie suckie."
792,"There's gotta be some HF out there pumping this up to dump or juice year end marks. That or Portnoy is pumping up the hype machine. Looked like the move was running out of steam this afternoon. Nothing wrong with the company long term but overbought at this level. They have a shot at capturing the online sports betting market thanks to their Barstool connection but lots of competition. Get in on the next pullback, it'll pop again."
793,Yeah I should have told everyone I dumped 3/4 of my shares right around there. That's a pretty obvious bottom signal.
794,"As you take the time to write out a full paragraph, retard."
795,PINS Is kicking too much ass to get out now
796,Big winner was a 12/31 18C bought at .33 sold at 3.5 (109 contracts)
797,Wait until you see their quarterly earnings
798,"speaking of vanna, kind concerned about  IV crush coming in Jan leading to a sell off. I think the IV premium is most likely pricing in the console sales report coming sometime in January, can't remember if we have an exact date but once the news released, I'm worried that the fallout from the IV risk premium being priced out could lead to a dump..."
799,I was so sure the resistance today wouldn't break when I bought calls for January today
800,Be greedy when others are fearful   Then again China is literally its own worst enemy   ReeeeeeeeeeeXI
801,That’s what happens when the rest of the world depends on you for cheap labor. It took a pandemic for these idiot leader to realize it lol
802,They bought 64000 puts at 2.13 ish. Theres another post about it somewhere.

809,"Buying Chinese stocks is a gamble no matter which stock it is. There are like 10 reasons why any of them can just evaporate at any second. Being ""not communist enough"" is a big one."
810,This isn’t r/stocks or r/investing
811,"Because you selling and buying in at 20 is lowering the value of the stock, and it’s giving shorts a cheaper price to get out. That’s why EVERYONE is saying not to sell."
812,I don’t buy puts
813,Honestly you’re fine. You would be fucked if the stock doesn’t blow past $30 but I anticipate $40 at the end of January so you won’t get burned

816,"You bought Tesla at ATH lulz.   Tesla’s bull run is out of gas. Being included in the index did this. Because Tesla is already grossly overvalued, a sudden pop in them is going to cause a serious shakeup in financial markets. Tesla will still grow yes but more modest.   Or I could be wrong and Tesla continues to shaft"
817,We all need to.
818,This one I think will cool down for a bit in January before ripping again after earnings. Great company great upside potential. Sold my jan 15 $20cs early but for profit
819,I've been reading more and more on LEAPs lately.  Seems like a solid way to invest.  What is your Jan 22 strike?
820,The speculated date is 1/12. I may have one too many chromosomes but me thinks it’s not coincidence that the MMs picked 1/15.
821,Saying that won't redeem your downvotes
822,I didn’t realize that SPACs were forbidden here. But that’s what I’ve been flipping.
823,Buy yourself a property from uwm with the profits ;)
824,"I’m totally gay, former bear general now Tesla general,  need an invite to the supposed exclusive new WSB sub"

839,You're gonna go from 17 grand to 19 grand. Big plays.
840,240 it says right there in the screenshot.   Im sitting on 240c 8/20s which are probably the most sensible play in my whole portfolio.
841,Yolo and CRM. Good luck.
842,I lost a lot of money holding Spaq before it turned to fisker and it has ruined my holding strategies.....sold Spaq at $9 went to $23 next day ....I suck at this
843,Did you try not being a retard and diamond hand these puppies?
844,ok but how much does this cost and how many big companies are there to pay it? how often do they need to buy it? is it something each big company will spend 1 million on and then done with? or ongoing costs? I don't see how this will lead to giant market cap even if what they do is useful.
845,It's been going over under 3200 Evey 30 minutes the past few days. Easiest $200 option profits ever.
846,"Like many others have said, if you TRULY want to be safe, buy the 4/21 25$+cs  &amp;#x200B;  I currently have 50 shares for the gang gang and 4 25$c for 4/21 . I do plan to add more contracts as that sweet sweet stimmy comes in but in reality I think once March comes along, all these contracts will be printing so bigly that there's no need to be impatient, the money isn't going anywhere.  &amp;#x200B;  Good luck my retards!"
847,The fuck does that matter? If the stock goes up 10% (hypothetical number) what you put in goes up 10%.  Wouldn't be surprised if their shit fucking pumps big this christmas.

856,"Just buy every spac you see on the CNBC ticker. I've put $3,000 into every one I've seen that is new to me. I now own 11 of them. 1 is down 11%, the rest are all up. I've turned $33,000 into $108,000 in my ""shrug"" portfolio. I've bought most of them after hours too, where they normally sell for a premium, because my wife's boyfriend allows me to have the TV on while I'm eating my hot pocket dinner. I literally don't know what any of these companies do or plan to do do except for one. It just bought out some company that does high end face sand blasting and I made $20,000.  I used to spend days of research to know if I want to jump into something (I still do for big money purchases) but this market is so dumb right now that I just gave up. SPACs it is. and some NIO"

865,It's just gotta hit $25 a share.... 🤷‍♂️ we shall see
866,"Would assume the average deal is multiple 7 figures a year, and its an ongoing service, so multi-year contracts. Not a one and done thing. They historically have been heavy in government but are expanding to the private sector, which has a much larger pool of clients.  As someone who's worked with major insurance carriers and healthcare providers, disparate systems and data storage is incredibly common. They want to aggregate and make use of that data but its incredibly difficult to do."
867,"&gt;I can’t win  Yeah, because you keep selling at a loss ya dumby."
868,"Just finish, and flush all of those Greek stuffs along with the dirty Kleenex. It’ll be alright."

872,This is the DD
873,Sold 1000 shares of thcb 2 days ago it happens move on and find a new wife
874,It's not over till it's over!
875,Wait what? THE monopoly is investigating a monopoly???
876,Rkt hit $31 and then plummeted. People aren't going to make the same mistake.  Oh and rocket is a way better company.
877,I was averaging down but these bags are getting heavier  RIP my Feb 290 Calls.
878,How much visibility do we really have into what’s going on this and all other Chinese stocks. I mean this wouldn’t be the first time we get screwed on Chinese stocks.
879,"I sold my 12/31 $165 C Splunk for $1.35 2 contracts last thursday., bought pltr calls.  now i cry"
880,He could have mysteriously disappeared and in 2 years CCTV will interview him and he’ll confess how bad of a citizen he was? Again that wouldn’t be the first time
881,Oh man I’m not sure I got the full facts but I think Zeus capital kept promoting tweets trying to trash Chainlink. And then they shared a screenshot with their short and liquidation price and the link marines pumped the price and squeezed them out!   It was pretty cool to witness a little bit of history 😂
882,Tesla is not a phone company
883,all in 40C JUN 2021
884,Currently plotting an all in yolo call soon to make up for my loss lol to be continued....what’s up with that stock been watching it moon for days who’s it merging with ?
885,You're comparing the two companies? Like the one that prints money against the one that bleeds money?
886,"this is a solid trade, i’m in 1/15. let’s get it!!"
887,Are you retarded?
888,Dude I love MGNI. MGNI to the moon. My avg is 13.80. So happy
889,"Stop trying to day trade. If you're just doing shares, buy and walk away check it once a week or some shit lok"
890,"Sounds good. You'll make some money but if you are hoping for 200% gains, best of luck."
891,"Their numbers in Pennsylvania are very underwheming. Have *you* looked at them? FanDuel and Draftkings are massacring them. They are a distant 3rd and have actually had a decrease in wagers from the previous month(in fairness so has Fanduel, while DraftKings has  increased their amount wagered along with their share).  Penn is losing ground in the only state they've been able to get their app up and running, and their legacy brick and mortar business is drowning in debt. The stock price is so blatant being held up by Stoolies, if you can't see that you deserve to lose your money. Good luck, homie.  tldr: DKNG 3/19/21 $75c"
892,It's a mortgage company.  Think RKT but worse.
893,"Yeha exactly - can’t help but feel like these gaming names are Cannabis 2.0. All this talk about legalization, TAM, etc.. but more hype than anything else. Right now all these guys are spending so much in customer acquisition costs"
894,Link? Because that would be concerning is somebody else had a screenshot of my account
895,Definitely doing it right. I’ll come back tomorrow.   For a follow up. Ever witnessed how SPACs trade? Going to get unloaded on tomorrow.
896,All in yolo trying to chase a big loss is not the play  Just take some time and relax
897,I can’t mAn lol ....weak hands ...Need that options yolo
898,By the law of averages you’re bound for a win in 2021. Keep throwing all of your money into options.
899,Lol alright I’ll show it one second
900,"If it makes you feel any better, you probably suck at a lot of other things too. Don't worry, keep trying, eventually you'll find something you're mediocre at."
901,Just remember Spacs are the king of undervalued. I was down on G I K for a few days and just held. Ended up shooting up 20% today. Similar with G H I V. Most spacs are up and down post merger announcement but leading up to ticker change they always go up.
902,Aren't the sales gonna be worse since there are a lot of people struggling from covid?
903,"Yes that does sound very nice, plenty of time to be right, think I mostly see dec/Jan calls here so I didn’t look too far out, god speed!"
904,I suck at everything but softball lol you are right

906,"They’ve been great... and worst comes to worse and the trade goes against you oh no, you own shares of freaking Amazon. Not a bad one to “bag hold” if needed."
907,Good luck! $CRM is ridiculously undervalued!
908,Well I got scammed with Trne dm because I couldn’t sell the stock on merger day ....woke Up to $-15k and I couldn’t sell ....so I sold when o could ....now it’s up lol
909,Where do I see every spac on the CNBC ticker?
910,Hope this doesn’t spread to nio
911,It found Bin Laden in a cave in the middle of the mountains.
912,If it’s manages to hit 20 I’m out.
913,"F that I got nio calls, not stupid sounding baba dabba dooo"
914,I’m actually even ....but the gain I would of had is still a loss in my book ....yolo soon
915,"Yeah this is far from stupid.  If this was a yolo OP would have to roll all his further out calls backwards, into the dec31 weekly"
916,Then it would qualify as a Yolo for sure. This degenerate is set
917,Pls let me know your next plays as I trust your judgment and would like to track them as well.
918,"I've worked with it, basically they provide a platform to create data engineering pipelines, so what's usually done by a few dev-ops engineers, and has to be maintained by them a lot of this would be replaced by the platform itself and also a lot of the scheduling of the jobs of the ETL, so it allow companies to save on a few engineers while having a pretty inferface.  &amp;#x200B;  the swiss company i worked with moved from AWS to palantir cuz they basically got palantir foundry for free, we also got the help of a few palantir engineers to help migrate all the pipelines from aws to palantir."
919,This is a paper account. I dont believe anyone can have this much money and be this retarded.
920,You’re a lot less fucked on this call than I am with my Jan 15 BABA call
921,"It’s end of year manipulation.   Watch the Cramer video, he even talks about buying large volume of Jan puts. And that shit is from 2000, this are boomer fund managers doing boomer shit.  Guess what’s harder than boomers?  Fucking 💎"
922,that alone should be enough to give pltr a very high valuation
923,Im a fucking retard and don’t understand call options and bought one today anyways. What do I fucking do with it? Says it’s good til the 31st
924,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-x-YYasGnQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-x-YYasGnQ)
925,I opened a 230/250/260 butterfly on CRM for... February?  If it hits 250 by Feb I'm going to be a very happy guy.
926,Your positions are too big  then  thats why your panicking i know everyone go all in  balls to the walls but there's a reason  sizing is important. its easier to stick to the plan when your not losing  more than your willing and there's no shame in playing in small but its really stupid to buy something  and  then just sell it for a loss. If still want to put down alot  go for leaps  still big gains why less stress.
927,Can confirm. Got theta cucked today from all my options. Sleep easier at night with those shares.
928,Gent BFT is going to be huge. Don’t sleep on this one.
929,Stop pumping it before I can get in
930,"These branch off at least once a year, nothing too special."
931,I kept buying more calls as it dipped to the point where I didn’t have funds to stop the bleeding .....held for 3 days straight losing 50% .....I had enough at that point ....naturally it ends up getting $60 price target from citron to give me one last kick in the balls
932,The guy hasn't missed with his acquisitions. Bullish on CRM.
933,"You talk to people in the industry, most of them would choose UWM over RKT. Better rates, better customer service. Easier all around experience for both parties. This is a big move if you did your DD. OP fucks"
934,Then I'll ride the anticipation wave and switch to flat calls after.  Unfortunately I will never ride earnings because that's how it is. People always expect too much.
935,"Nah, I’m old enough to remember pets.com. Pet stuff brought the entire dot com bubble down. This shit is the bringer of death. The destroyer of worlds.  This is the equivalent of an action start making a kids movie. We done. Puts on everything."
936,I too am super long on PTON. Made about 15k so far. Long pton!
937,which it will
938,Dw man we got this. I bought 50 of these today as well.
939,"If you say so, bud.  I'm happy with my plays. This one is pretty sucky imo"
940,A Nigerian prince emailed me and said if I send him money he’ll combine it with his pltr investment and we can split the profit
941,"After earnings, I'm pretty sure you'll get crushed. Just a guess. Bullish TSLA, but there's not a lot of room to go higher (imo) compared to other plays."
942,For what it's worth you didn't lose all your money like some of the retards in this sub so.... there's that
943,This man has tranches.
944,And now his watch has ended
945,"I wish that I had bought TTD when it was cheap. I am going to hold this for a while, not that worried.  This is from October, but good to know: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-magnite-stock-surged-higher-on-tuesday-2020-10-13"
946,It’s a RKT wannabe mini me. Basically: all I care about my profit fuck everyone else type of a business. No thanks
947,"Looking like a bitch with my $500, just got in today"
948,You can't catch em all just buy gme shares 🚀🚀
949,Neither all time nor any positions ... could literally be deposits
950,I bought a $30 call lol down on it
951,Giving him the option to buy at 30 when the price itself is 30 makes it worth 0.
952,Wait holy shit are you serious? Can you a link an article for that please?
953,Hope they are not FDs it might print I too own 30c
954,"I think $36 is a very conservative target for march, which makes you a few hundred bucks. You could easily see 40 or 50 by then for a huge win"
955,Wait.... This isn't a meme at all.
956,"Honestly this event actually made me quite sad, both for myself and the state of this subreddit which I love oh so much. With u/zjz leaving we are coming that much closer to becoming overrun with spammers, pump and dumpers, and other nefarious groups pursuing their own personal self interests. And yes I know, the best defence against this kind of bullshit is self education and whatnot but it still wont prevent the overall quality of the posts on this sub to take a fucking nose dive.   That is the part I find most distressing because I get some of my best plays reading the DDs from the autists here. Plays like GME, PLTR, SHOP, etc. Nowadays everytime I look at a DD I can't help but feel that it is now much more likely to be a pump and dump by some shady hedge fund.   I don't know guys, maybe we did get too big for our own good, maybe we should have gone private before we hit 1million members, either way, this whole thing just makes me sad."
957,Market cap is too high. Idiots are buying now
958,Done this too many times. Never this big of a gain but SBE PLUG CRWD to name a few
959,He's still a mod with full perms.
960,what are y’all’s cost basis for pton?
961,"You’re not betting on black again. you’re betting on a catalyst that has moved the stock historically, based on this data. low vol right now should tell you it’s worth the bet"
962,Pretty much Google Search using its client data.  There are some good youtube videos you can check to understand what they do.
963,"Yeah, I’m thinking it’s more like a game of hungry hungry hippos though.   The dump, and industry knows that’s their shot to pick up the slack. Not enough to go around, so, they shake the trees for another week or two.   Then it’s Karpal tunnel-vision to the moon. Rocket rocket rocket."
964,This mf has 100k but is on cricket wireless 🤡  Welcome home
965,"I thought anti monopoly probe was last months news? Weird that this sell-off is so large. Oh well, time to load up on more calls."
966,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trtworld.com/magazine/israel-linked-cia-funded-palantir-goes-public-making-espionage-mainstream-40230/amp  It’s mentioned here a little bit. It’s obviously hard for anyone to go into any significant detail about such classified information but it certainly seems like the were heavily involved.
967,When does cnbc talks about spacs? Im gonna watch it
968,I think he means that the government will give any retarded contractor money but pltr is the best retard of the bunch so they'll be getting all the tendies soon enough.
969,"Valid argument.  I think the exception with Palantir is the UI allows you to pull data into one query to compare. Instead of a cloud, which provides access to all your data in one spot, Palantir will integrate all that separate data into your query.   ""Show me info about John Doe123.""  Cloud - ""Here are 47,624 search results for John Doe123. Have fun writing manual sortation queries!""  Palantir - ""Here are 47,624 search results for John Doe123. 16,252 results are associated by 1 degree of separation. 1,982 associations were generated in the past 12 months. 38% of results were generated by activity in the South Eastern United states. Here's a heat map of all known activity. Here is the most associated result, with 275 nodes leading to this data point. Etc, etc, etc""  Palantir organizes data quickly and efficiently, can be customized out the ass, and can teach itself to return more relevant data if programmed so."
970,"Someone bought a fuckton of it an hour or 2 before close and shot the price up like 1.50, instantly sold and I’ll get back in when it drops again   Bark gang baby"

974,"Yeah same I'm long on this company. It is by far the largest portion of my portfolio. And I got my first leap on them, a 27c 2023"
975,I would just hold. People are arguing about the car being a good idea or not. They’ll realize it’s Apple and Xmas and it’ll go back up.
976,"Yeah, that sucks, the dilution of shares was a kick in the gut. I always knew it would climb back up and had no problem waiting for it, but, you know, shares don’t expire..."
977,Robinhood doesn't have any :(

980,"This short counterparty is gonna short attack again and pay for headlines like “GME posts record profits, but will it be enough? Investors don’t think so” LMFAO im telling u now homie. I already started cashing out Jan calls, Ryan Cohen is the X factor here but thing is he knows management is gonna flop at inspiring confidence and shorts will attack again. Rolling into some later calls but im never fucking going into ER or anything with a full GME position ever again, im cashing the fuc out and buying the fucking dip"
981,So you mean wait for feb for a dip to buy more in?
982,Dont avg down on losing short term options just diamond hand them maybe buy a few if they hit -80% as a yolo but always never more then your willing to burn.   Thats why you go for leaps they don't get as hard from a crash and you just have more time to wait .

Customer retention is 90%, because once you start using it you realize going back to the old analytics SOP is a time sink you can no longer afford,  because Palantir helped accelerate your business growth by decreasing the time it takes to gather data for crucial decisions."
986,Literally all of your stocks have been up lol.
987,So Palantir is the AI that's going to take over the world. Got it. YOLO before our new overlord takes over!
988,I'm a retard. I had some nice options on it like a week ago or so and sold them for a loss.
989,a bearded clam confection
990,They're called renewable licenses
991,No it just sounds better because every word starts with S
992,Covid just means that more people are using Amazon instead of traditional brick-and-mortar stores.
993,NBA is back. We’re going to the moon. 🚀
994,Wow impressive lol or as you put it *wild* haha
995,They’re opening Sports books. Including betting apps in legal states. With the Barstool logo and name. Stool clowns are degenerate sports gamblers. 🤷‍♂️
996,"I see, this clears things up, thanks. one other question I have, how easy would palantir be to imitate? once they have created this revolutionary service, how easy would it be for other palantirs to pop up and take away market share?"
997,There is a Microsoft Store?
998,"Yup, they sold the Tropicana on the Vegas strip for a rent credit from their landlord. And are now leasing the building."
999,For real. Oh hey 260 is a good price!...Just kidding. Now to continue averaging down or bail?
1000,"No offense, but i love the -4900 and -2700 trades that are still visible incase we thinking ur hiding massive gainz.  idk maybe intentional and the middle is going brrrr"
1001,PTON is like AMZN in 2016. Could trade sideways for a bit but it will be $500 plus by 2025. I have 400k Pton and it’s my forever position.
1002,Can you sell me your next contracts? You seem to have a knack for this.
1003,"I was in #1 first, now in #3, !2MG, AMC1, !3FT GH!\/"
1004,"Palantir currently holds 452 software related patents.  I'm not a software engineer, so I'm not sure how straight forward it would be to copy their methods, but the zeal with which they patent suggests that as long as an enterprise wasn't commercializing similar software, it could be duplicated for use in house by any large company with enough cash to sink into the development.  But they wouldn't be able to sell the service, and I don't know that any company would be eager to reinvent an existing product just for themselves."
1005,"I worked an internship for a large corporation this summer, and I was astonished by how poorly their data was used. Palantir is legitimately the future."
1006,So if I have stock in this and still have a profit should I cut and see what happens?
1007,"Well, I'm going to sit back and do nothing. Why sell on the day when everyone is selling and why buy more when there is so much political tensions and uncertainty."
1008,You beat me to it.
1009,"I'm calling a 5% increase after holiday sales numbers - this will be Amazon's biggest increase ever YoY by FAR. Most physical stores closed, people ordering online way earlier this year, and most other online retailers the delivery is too slow to arrive by xmas, so you turn to AMZN.  This company was built for a pandemic. I'm in 30k deep, 2 contracts 12/31 and 1/15 ITM options."
1010,Another thing I have learned in my disastrous month with options. Diamond hands is a real thing. One of the options I was about to give up on in the same expiry date as you went up 125% today. Still at a loss but I would not have made it less of a loss if I had panicked.
1011,I mean as someone 150k deep I can only hope so.
1012,"This is garbage and of all the things PLTR does very well, this was not one of them. There is a reason any time anyone references this, is is always to an article that mentions PLTR being supposedly linked to the US locating him, but never anything more than an article talking about another article stating that.  Finding OBL or UBL or whatever you wanna call him was nearly 100% HUMINT, and the human Intel that led to locating him has been well documented through various studies (actual university academic studies about it), books, memoirs, and interviews. This is further backed by all the stuff that has been declassified now about how notoriously old school Osama's system was **specifically to avoid the programming prowess** that PLTR and other entities and agencies have. And that old school, paper only, hand delivered info via couriers system successfully defeated all the computer power in the world for many years.  But sure, all those documented stories from people involved, versus some articles referencing uncited articles about PLTR locating Osama, take your pick."
1013,"10% in HK. It will hit 220 tomorrow. Then lower. If there was any time to get the fuck out, it's now"
1014,"Homie I've got Jan 15 $270 strikes, I'm retarded why are you asking me."
1015,"It is. Their software is balls to the wall good. I've used some of the stuff they've sold to the G that seamlessly integrates data from dozens of sources of wildly varying types (one data source that is XLS spread sheets, one that is scanned typed documents, one that is government database info, etc) and spits it out in an easy to use UI that a 50 year old with little computer experience can understand.  It is great stuff. I still believe the current price is way over valued, but that doesn't mean it won't be $50 a share next year, and beyond. Just overpriced now. But meme stocks gonna meme."
1016,"PALAGANG, our time is NOW! 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
1017,"Oh dang that's awesome you've actually used it, thanks for telling me! Yeah i think it just grew too fast after IPO and is essentially just consolidating right now. But after the lockout period ends and it drops I feel like it'll be more open to some organic natural growth"
1018,why? does it break some rule? (genuine question)
1019,"Yeah, but he wasn’t getting another retards to suck his dick, so he had to make a big deal about it."
1020,Anyone who has stocks no need to worry. Everyone having calls...im sorry for you
1021,"Yeah, it’s so people don’t come on here and pump stocks that are considered unproven"
1022,"Yeah nvm all the meme companies with $100-500B market caps, PLTR's $45b is way too high"
1023,"China looked at Jack Ma and said, time to teach him a lesson."
1024,We don’t like to use that word here... please revise your language.
1025,"Never bet on red you commie, this shit ain’t cheap for nothing"
1026,Damn that is a good point. I think I’ll buy 1 more share tomorrow and then wait it out see where it goes.
1027,"Im sorry but you don’t deserve money, you don’t know how to handle, somebody smarter needs it"
1028,You shouldn’t have sold them. A 200k profit is better than a 20k loss.
1029,So that was you at the end of the day? Well done sir.
1030,Make sure you don't melt your hands in the shower since they're apparently made of very thin paper.
1031,"Where's your LGVW, CGRO, and STPK? Also watch Switchback 2, Bright lights acquisition, and Star peak 2. Last 3 aren't listed yet."
1032,Hold fuck it and wait
1033,CRM is a good bet long term. I’m in as well
1034,It seems like it! Thanks for the input Dude! Good luck with everything &amp; hope you have an amazing Christmas!
1035,I have a 240c 1/15/21 thinking of rolling it to March cause I'm down 50%. Don't know whether to roll it or paper hand that bitch.
1036,Thank you! Best of luck to you as well.
1037,Is there a website you use to get them? I don’t want to watch CNBC but I also like money
1038,Too far out IMO I have May 20~ish $50 calls. This thing is super coiling and triple topping and people still want even more PLTR. This stock can be $200-300 EASY. I’m hoping this thing bangs up to $50 in the next month then I’m using all those profits to buy 1 YR out whatever the highest calls they are selling and holding. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
1039,"Are you kidding lmao? We're in the worst period of covid, Amazon has been up the most from mega cap tech because ecommerce has being doing so well. Guess who dominates ecommerce during a pandemic when everyone is staying inside?"
1040,Show your positions then if you so confident
1041,Depends what your break even is. If it’s less than 136 I’d say hold.
1042,True shares do make for a much better nights sleep. Or hedging with puts. Either or
1043,I bought PLTR because you retards told me to. $28.50 call on a .70 premium for 100 shares. I’m assuming if the stonk goes over$29.20 I buy them all for $28.50 and pay the premium? Then do I sell them back after?
1044,We’re opening at 245 most likely so.... depends on your option strike/expiry. I bought 280 calls expiring Feb a couple days ago looking for a reversal (position sizing is fine)... they’re most likely opening -100% tmr morning.
1045,Buy the MSOS ETF it has only American weed companies in its holdings and it has options. I’ve been making crazy money off it since a month after it opened
1046,"Then you still make a shit Tom of money and you can just let it run! Either way is good, if you go shorter calls you can buy more calls and if it moons quick you make more, but you have way higher risk due to theta decay and short time frame for stock to moon. Your way is smarter/safer, I’m just going full retard. Probably shouldn’t take advice from internet stranger retards TBH."
1047,"One thought, all he said is that he will stop “moderating”. Nothing about not being a mod anymore.   Many mods mod without moderating. I think that’s what MM stands for"
1048,You’re stupid but okay
1049,"Lol, plugged the crack while it’s spilling over the top"
1050,"I have amazon shares, and im not going to post it as my broker doesn't let me take screen shots. Plus the size of my position is pretty pathetic. Its kind of sad someone has to spell it out that amazon has been doing well because of covid, and with new lockdowns+Christmas they should shatter last years sales"
1051,Hes too far gone now..its yolo win or lose it all no in between
1052,Roll it definitely. Earnings are early March and they always beat the expectations. Plus it’s only been less than a month since the drop resulting from the Slack buyout. What we’re seeing now is just the start of the momentum upwards.
1053,"Look on the bright side, you were right, just gotta commit to being willing to lose it."
1054,"wanted to correct you but I just thought, nah fuck it"
1055,I have a call list that is too long to even catch in a screen shot drag.   I'm already here you retard.
1056,Dude just stick to stocks and only sell when you have profit. Split up your cash on 10-15 stocks (only the popular shit and a couple weird pennys to scratch your gambling itch) Check it once a week and count your tendies later. Plan on holding til 2030.
1057,Not it.
1058,"Fuck this guy, it's Sonic."
1059,"I hope his other hobby behind Wendy's isn't mediocre, I'm headed there now."
1060,I'm not a pussy. I'm buying Baba calls.
1061,Loaded up on 4/16/21 $3400 calls. Hope you’re right.
1062,"Yes.  Jackie boy supremely fucked off all of the worst possible people.  Oh, you think we don't regulate enough?  OK...."
1063,I’ve had them for a few weeks now. I’ve been selling 4% OTM weeklies to make up for some of the theta decay and have been doing well. I also have a March 19 $3700 call.
1064,"I fall under C , PLTR 🚀🚀🚀"
1065,No one forced you to buy shit you don’t understand. Don’t blame the Autist for your retarded play lol  PLTR to the moon tho tbh
1066,I mean to be completely fair HUMINT can totally feed into a system like palantir’s Gotham. The key benefit for a mission like tracking Bin Laden is the ways in which Gotham can create networks of related/connected people and how the intelligence flows together.  I have no clue if it was or wasn’t involved but saying that it was driven by people collecting intelligence in no way proves that such a software was used.
1067,"The most important thing I learned to start actually making money was patience. It's pretty excruciating to watch yourself lose money in real time but if you believe in your plan and your stock picks you have to trust that you'll be fine long term. Also I stopped buying FDs and bought calls a couple months out, then switched to leaps"
1068,You had 3 weeks Pussy why sell now
1069,"I like the way the chart looks, I like that it’s trading below ATH. Valuation is high, but price to sales isn’t terrible honestly. I’m not super bullish, but I’m definitely neutral bullish — I don’t see it digging any time soon."
1070,Pretty sure they explicitly avoid utilizing AI because Peter Thiel thinks humans are better decision makers currently. They aggregate the data and present it in predetermined ways to allow analysts to make inferences on their own.
1071,"Sure, analysis of pocket trash and documents and stuff, ripping data off captured phones, laptops, etc is a 100 times faster in a system like that than people doing it, but the osama situation was extremely simple. A tip from a source and a few steps from there Osama's courier was captured, and shortly after he was neutralized."
1072,Gotta drop your positions man.  Idk without seeing the positions but this looks a lot like luck...would advise to take the money and run while you’re ahead
1073,"Similar thoughts. Technicals predict a move, with past trends i assume its a bullish one. No news, so most likely catalyst is lockdown driven shopping."
1074,"He’s saying just wait for the earnings to come in before selling. People shedding now are literally retarded, not even acoustic.   ER is gonna be solid, so the lead up to Feb should be strong. If ER confirms, it will likely go up unless the great ER gets priced in."
1075,Can you toggle it to show the overall position percentage gain? 26% in like 90 days is pretty fucking crazy with just shares.
1076,It’s only a loss if you sell. Hold on for dear life
1077,"As someone who isn’t especially familiarized with this sub and zjz, what’s so sad about their resignations?"
1078,"Nah. It won't. SPACs typically spike after LOI, then DA, then merger if it's an EV stock. Sometimes, however, a SPAC will get serious attention between these steps. When this happens, it's usually because its trading as a derivative of another SPAC that already merged and is soaring. Look at Gig3capital/lightning eMotors and Tuscan Holdings. Both trading as derivatives of XL fleet and Quantum scape respectively.  STIC isn't spiking for any of the aforementioned reasons. It's because ""pets"" are a massive secular growth play. People love their dogs. Millennials can't afford children or don't want them and they fill the emotional void with animals. So they spoil them by buying expensive shit. I've seen tons of articles about the pet industry booming for the last 2 years or so. STIC will go up long term, it's undervalued at this price level. It's gonna get valued like Chewy, which is to say, really damn high. Other SPACs will start doing this too at some point. SSPK is a prime candidate since legal pot is a similarly growth-rich industry."
1079,Now he can pay off those creditors and finally switch to Verizon 5G
1080,Not if you have a lisp
1081,He has an instruction booklet  Step 1- buy sportscar Step 2- Paul Walker yourself
1082,Doesn’t include THCB gains but here you go https://i.imgur.com/308lwPT.jpg. Also this is since Nov 9th so around 40 something days.
1083,"Amzn is a big dnc donor, so unless eu folks start something - not worried about policy/politics driven events. Would wait    a bit, probably iron condor is right play otherwise."
1084,Where are they traded? Just out of curiosity
1085,Nice don't fuck it up like me within a month now.
1086,So deep I can see Adele rolling in
1087,You might as well be walkin on the sun
1088,Cut and stay the f away from Pooh Bear stonks.
1089,"I had the same thought, barkbox is too close to pets.com and it would be so poetic if it brought on the impending doom."
1090,deep ITM positions basically act like shares so you'd sell and go to a strike more close to the actual stock price
1091,"Oh shit. If he releases another 13D tomorrow, on the 13th day of the SHO reg list... 🚀🚀🚀"
1092,"All in on your mom, expiring inside of her,"
1093,F
1094,We’re at ATH right now though?? You mean the top like a month ago and you been getting fucked by Theta??
1095,Just checked it out $6.13 for Jan 22 50C. Why not just spend $10.00 on 30C? You collect higher Delta and your contract will be ITM a lot sooner?
1096,But as long as it gets past 35.11 he’s ok right?
1097,do we really predict a dip when lock up ends? if so how how much can we expect it to dip pessimistically and optimistically
1098,Why don’t we just make our own subreddit and look for mods?
1099,Bc they are 4X what I paid. I have 4 times as many contracts with 3 months extra Theta.
1100,"Sure bro, 1 warehouse in alabama partly unionizing is 100% going to take down amazon and all the positive catalysts that they have going into the holiday season in 2020."
1101,Everyone expects their earnings to be gold so they would have to blow it out of the water in order to see significant pop.
1102,"I remember reading a comment from u/zjz the other day something to the effect “ehh yeah the subs not as retarded as it used to be. Still nowhere near smart, but not mega retarded anymore”  Paraphrased the shit outta that but sad to read that one day and see him gone the next.   RIP"
1103,"I'm with you: [https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754877/amazon-record-holiday-sales-figures-instore-retailers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754877/amazon-record-holiday-sales-figures-instore-retailers)  They released this on Dec. 1st and said they just had their ""biggest holiday season to date”. If they reiterate this stuff on Monday and with actual numbers, we're going to see a massive green day Monday."
1104,"I understand the first one, 50% loss so at the very least you can scrounge up what little dignity you had left. But goddamn dude, you were down near 90% on the second one, just let that one go to expiry and hope for some hail mary."
1105,What Calls are you talking about? What expiration date and strike?
1106,"Thanks for the tenders, ‘tard.  Just kidding, I feel you. I did that in the beginning too... important thing is to learn from it and get better.  Good luck 👍🏻"
1107,Congrats on the gains but this sub is going to shit. I feel like half the shit posted now is fucking shares. Can we go back to gambling?
1108,"Good riddance, we don’t need mods"
1109,"Bro im done trying to convince you here. You're clearly very stubborn. Dont invest in amazon if you dont want to, thats your fucking problem lol"
1110,I saw it in Afghanistan as well. I think our guys were building programs and apps on how to feed it data.
1111,Did that w aapl could have bought two weeks ago and my port would be a Shrek boner by now
1112,Same sold off 300 shares other day only had 100 left once it shot up
1113,"I sold my LMND 12/18 65c's for a loss mid Nov, would have been an 8x return if I held onto them."
1114,"What about ""Be greedy when others are fearful""?"
1115,Buy and hold. Can’t lose if you don’t sell. Until expiration lol
1116,Weird I can lose bunch of money not care but if I take an L and the stock runs up shortly after it’s the worst fucking feeling makes me salty
1117,At least it has actual sick profits and margins rather than companies selling you a dream like QS with no actual sellable product and revenue lmfao.

1169,You both have a point
1170,Yeah and I bet it will go much higher. I was just putting into perspective how much 3.7 mil could make u by just holding a dividend etf LOL
1171,Short term: sell ASAP and buy in a couple days when it corrects   Long term: hold for a good 5 years when electric car batteries are starting to become more and more in demand. Autist.

1175,"Lol yes, but this is someone who essentially YOLO'd $100k on a company that could've gone bankrupt. I don't think dividends are for him"
1176,Now thats the quality DD we come here for.

1181,question is when he sells he won't say so everyone has to time their own peak for this.   I'm long as well

1186,so tesla calls?
1187,"Funny. If that would be me, I‘d call it a life, retire and end my career tomorrow. Congratulations and fuck you."
1188,What if some smart MM got the idea to buy a fuckload of calls and then close their shorts?
1189,This place has turned to shit in a matter of 20 minutes

1193,Wild ride. I bought 8 Feb calls this morning and was up &gt;200%  My warrants are looking +100% after being down 8% at open.  Let’s hope for a $31 price target on $GOEV next

1207,"MicroVision, it's a small company that has mostly focused on research and development with a laundry list of valuable patents. Mostly focused around solid state lidar sensors and laser projection. They finally started getting some attention from Microsoft, Ford, and there was some whispers Apple was interested in acquiring them as well. The price finally took off rewarding all of the long time holders that actually believed in the company, and Hindenburg wanted a piece of the pie so they tweeted some bullshit about it being a husk of a company with no intellectual property and that they were going to short it. The reality is anyone with a smooth brain and a pair of eyes can take a look at their patent list including newly issued patents this week, and know that Hindenburg is full of shit. But stupid retail buyers bought in on the rise and panic sold because of hindenburg's tweet, it did exactly what they hoped it would do. And in doing so they not only vaporized about 30%, they threw a wrench in the very negotiations they hope to benefit from. Fuck those guys."
1208,"Gains is gains though. You can be mad at him, but at least he didn't fuck you over by convincing you to buy the shares while shorting the peaks behind your back."

1211,"No, just hold. FOMO causes those feelings when you see the losses during the first few days/weeks. I have all of my spare cash in GME too (all inned at 15.4 last Friday) and I'm convinced this is a $30 stock next year."
1212,"Good, fuck him. His bot would remove posts with 2 (vote to remove) as if 2 votes is enough. Reddit already removes posts with like -10. Let the retards run the asylum. We dont need a mod that gets all uppity because he can read."
1213,"I've been buying a lot of shares around 91,5 so I hope it moves soon, think it's being supressed by the news of the apple and microsoft chips because it was doing great before that and it's products are basically all sold out, powering the consoles too which are selling very well."

1217,My guess would be a certain number of quality D posts+ long time member + high 5 figure or even 6 figure gain porn
1218,&gt; This attitude is probably why you’re never gonna reach even close to 3.7mil.  yep. That is such a true statement. Big difference is some people have a fall back and others don't.

1231,"I've purposely not recommended this much here because this company does still have a fairly small market cap, people dipping in and out is not going to help investors or the company. Take a look at their patent list, if you know anything about lidar or laser projection you'll know you need to buy and forget about it until it's bought out. If you're looking to make a couple of bucks tomorrow, please don't. It's only fucking up negotiations."
1232,$500? try $100.. People panicked on that last drop and it was barely 20% dip.
1233,I bought some. Seriously thinking of selling my 100 Tesla shares and putting it all in gme but you know that missed the boat feel
1234,"What happens if Melvin Capital goes broke and can not cover their full position, has anybody thought about that? Is that a possibility?"

1241,"This guy is a true fucking moron if he doesn't take profit, and soon. He'll be reminscing over the fact that he was close to 4 million on a worthless stock like GameStop, all because a autistic pet company owner increased his stake in a failing blockbuster from 10% to 13%"
1242,So how much does a replacement cost?
1243,Bingo. This DFV boss has nerves of adamantium.
1244,Ha! Go check out DFV’s last comment (it was his/her only reply to the post before this).
1245,Seriously. That $ is almost exactly what I’ve calculated is the sum I’d have to magically come into to immediately retire instead of grinding out these last ~15 years.
1246,So who is the main mod aka retardos maximus?
1247,"Hold, I've heard DD from outside WSB at $27, $44, and just recently $50+ on seeking alpha.  This isn't factoring a squeeze."

1249,I have 1k shares but all the contracts were only $300. Fuck it
1250,Have you figured out your exit strategy yet?  I nominate /u/DeepFuckingValue to be on the BOD of GME. Do I have a second?
1251,"Great, now wsb is going to be flooded with questions like ""How do I buy a share?"", ""What are options?"" every day."
1252,Lol he thinks hes gonna get an answer  This alpha  just posts n then does nothin
1253,I've heard that dude stinks like hell from across the room. I'd hate to see the type of woman who would bang him.

1255,"This article is from August 2020.  It went up about 10% after this article came out(hitting \~$20), then dropped back down, and has been trading between $17-$20 for months...  Is there something I'm missing?"
1256,For now
1257,That would be the very smart thing to do but I’m guessing bears are so sure of their thesis that they’re willing to double down
1258,You're not in but you should have put 50 in. Dip buying in this stock is pretty predictable and you need extra $$$ to do that.
1259,"This guy went in on a company basically on the verge on bankruptcy, based on some DD, the hope that cohen would behave like a good human being and the sheer weight of his immense balls of steel.  He kept his position (aside from some lesser profit taking) for months, when basically anyone (me included) were saying that he was crazy.  He kept posting his position to WSB each week, for months after being rebuked and misunderstood each time.  He is the true autist. A real Burry-esque hero of WSB and probably will have his username written in some financial analysis peer-reviewd paper some year in the future.  Now the GME fight is far from over, but I can assure you that he will came up on top.  THAT is why he gets to make money without doing anything. Because he has done more than enough to earn it before even clicking the ""buy"" button."

1263,"The fucking pinned Gamestop post is really telling. [That dude was calling for GME to go to zero when it was at $4.32 a share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etgv8j/gme_short_bubble/ffgo4fw/), and now he's saying the same shit with it at $20... and they fucking pinned it!"
1264,"Lol, no one is gonna force him to sell at a loss though?    I hope the market does crash a bit so we can all buy the dip!"
1265,"Yep, so stonks go up"
1266,This is a spread. They bought the 24s and sold the 20s.
1267,"As I said on the main post, why doesn't he make a new WSB, jettison the dead weight, and start fresh?"
1268,It is for GME. It’s just showing the big put option orders

1277,youre gucci bro amd is bound to break 100 soon. thats the thing about options they can go from -50% to +400 you gotta learn to be emtionless
1278,That sounds impossible. Are they scanning reddit somehow? Can't wrap my head around that
1279,bro he made a million in ONE HOUR at market open yesterday
1280,If you go on any porn site you'll see many of them.
1281,More like someone who doesn’t buy near ATH without catalyst or huge dip that is around the 3 month bottom support. Just sell those as soon as you come out even.

1295,Next time it pumps sell covered calls at least
1296,"&gt;So they where paid to pin it?  No idea, but it seemed really fucking fishy to me. Especially when you consider there is a fund that is literally losing millions every day. How much coverage favorable to your position do you think $50,000 would buy?"
1297,What's a share?
1298,"Bro ur backing a trash mod with ur bullshit over a filter that never worked, kindly fuck off idiot"

Please stop acting like you know when you don't. The result that pops up at the top of Google isn't always right. The ticker for the stock that appears is SOX, not PHLX.

1313,Is mayonnaise a stock?

1326,"Selling a covered call means that you are putting up 100 shares that you own and agreeing to sell  at a certain price if the option buyer chooses to exercise the option.  You make money by selling the contract itself and the only loss with covered calls is potential profit (if you set a strike above your average cost per share).  If I sell a covered call with a strike price of $20, I collect a premium immediately for selling the option. If the stock price ends below $20 by the expiration date, it expires worthless and your profit is the premium.  If the stock price ends over $20 and gets exercised, I sell 100 shares at $20 and also keep the premium. The loss of profit comes from if the stock price rises above $20 since you are selling for that amount."
1327,It's the matrix
1328,Why is my account red and reading a balance of $0.00?
1329,Nah a place with some chicken tendies.
1330,You'll be fine. The article about Microsoft and Amazon making their own chips affects Intel more than it does AMD. Also none of the information was confirmed by Microsoft or Amazon. Meaning  the rumored chips mostly affected server chips where Intel is the market leader. Also it was all rumor. AMD has alot going for it before that news got out. Namely that they have 7nm processors whereas INTC still isn't slated to offer theirs till 2022. AMD is actually a pretty good bet for 2021 because the conditions are ripe for them to take market share away from INTC.  Should recover but I don't think it's dropping below 90 until expiry
1331,I'll throw a grand into this
1332,"What? The loss depends on how much shares the person own , if the person owns 100k shares he will lose 100k when GME goes down a $1."
1333,"I mean it wasn't as crazy as you're making it sound. He saw the potential value just like Cohen did. He could cash out now and retire as a multimillionaire, or stick to what he originally wanted to do. In this case, it was help GME rocket to the moon."

1336,"It’s the safest way to use options:  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/covered-call.asp  If you hold shares you can sell calls for an “out of the money” strike price (above the current stock price).    Today I sold covered calls for a $30 strike with a 1/15/21 expiration.  I got about $150 per call (100 shares), effectively reducing my cost basis by $1.50 per share.  If the stock doesn’t hit $30 by expiry I keep the $1.50 per share and I still keep all my shares.  If it hits $30 on or before 1/15/21, all my shares get sold automatically at a price of $30 (still a huge profit for me that I’m happy selling at). I also get to keep the $1.50 premium so basically I would selling my shares at $31.50/share.  And let’s say it does hit $30 but I get greedy and start to regret selling the calls and I wish I could stay in, I can always just buy the shares to get right back in.  It’s basically a no-loss scenario other than the odd chance that the price rockets past the $30 price point so fast that you can’t even rebuy back in at that price if you wanted to (I.e a short squeeze) but again even that is not an actual loss because you were ok with selling your shares at the $30 strike price."
1337,Gravity is the driving force behind a Nikola truck
1338,"I think there's a very strong case for $50 too, but I don't think it's ""almost guaranteed"" as much as $30 is. I mean, a few more days like last 2 days and we're about to touch $30, doesn't even take that much any more..."

1354,"Let me clarify some misunderstandings here:  Reddit doesn't remove posts based on upvotes, however, you can change your settings to autohide posts and comments below a certain threshold.  His bot would remove posts based on a user's history of correct votes to remove. It would take ages to get to a point where you had removed enough posts correctly to be able to remove a post with just 2 people.   The people that were doing that were on /new for what seemed like hours a day, every day.   And if a user votes incorrectly to remove something that shouldn't be? Their score would be cut in half."

1357,U know its funny i thought the pinning was kind of wall of shaming him since it had 0 upvotes and was just so obviously wrong  R the mods rly that wack ?
1358,First Fuzzy now this.  Big sad.

1366,Fuzzy wuzzy was a 🐻
1367,Obviously referring to a calendar month since that expires 1/22 and today is 12/23. That’s a month.
1368,900 shares @ $21.74 is your problem. If you didn't have those shares then you wouldn't have a problem. Problem solved! You can jerk me off later.
1369,"Yes, most humans are retarded. But only the chosen few can be autistic retards. I will follow you all to the next sub."
1370,Don't forget to tell people about the AR halolens/IVAS army contract with micros tech inside... Been in since the halolens tear down and holding till the buyout.
1371,Not even that. There’s so many shitty memes that get posted constantly. Even without the wsbvotebot this place was going to shit. We needed a paper account contest a long time ago. Now it’s going to get worse faster.
1372,This is the market top. I just know it.
1373,Soooo....you are going to exercise those right?
1374,So what do?
1375,"To be fair majority of what I removed was pure garbage, and I didn’t discriminate. There’s just so much of it."
1376,What calls are good to buy?
1377,"I spent too long trying to do good work on Twatter.  When they blocked me for some nonsense, I decided to go read only .  Thanks for the excuse !  &amp;#x200B;  Sounds like this guy is doing himself the same favor"
1378,He went to other subs. He's largely inactive now though.
1379,It's necessary
1380,Same. Wait.. does the report go to the 🌈mods who pinned it? 😟
1381,People are still short on Tesla?
1382,"No... Just no. It's was a break off community when WSB first went private back in April or May. They had a huge influx of members and then WallStreetBets came back and everyone left.  Their community is dead. Nobody posts, nobody speaks, they get maybe 10 comments on the daily thread (That is posted by a user). It's not some special place."
1383,"That's that boomer shit, you weren't there"
1384,"That IVAS actually looks usable, everything until now has basically been a feeling of oh that's neat but we're still a few years away. Not anymore, I think it's finally to the point it could be deployed in special use cases to collect feedback from soldiers to further development. I don't know why I need one, but I want to play with one for sure. Lol"
1385,"Well you can buy the call back and then sell the shares.  If the stock price has dropped, the call will be cheaper than what you sold it for originally so you won’t really have lost any money from the call itself just whatever you lost on selling your shares as normal"

1392,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/armys-futuristic-combat-goggles-lets-soldiers-battlefield/story?id=74791465  Watch the video if you haven't yet. I believe the army is getting 29000 units this year. It's a microsoft product but has some micros chips and patents.
1393,He said this because he has bet big against it. Essentially the one fundamental most in the industry disagree with. Without Lidar those cars are going to start killing people at higher tiers of automation. They're building these cars in California right now and they can't even see through wildfire smoke. Foggy morning? Nope can't see through that either. At some point he's going to need to admit defeat and bring on lidar. It's only a matter of time.
1394,"So, mods are gay is what you are saying. Interesting..."
1395,Surprisingly the Jan 2023 $30 call isn’t that expensive we know it’s gonna hit thirty before then. I predict this price won’t be low for long.  Diamond hands till 2023.
1396,Well not anymore I assume...also I was wrong to just list the change in share price....the actual amount list by shorts is [about 35 billion](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/04/investing/tesla-short-sellers-elon-musk/index.html) which is still insane!

1402,Just wait til that Jan 20c prints when we are @ 40 then !
1403,Im going to miss this place. Hopefully when it falls apart there'll be people who remember it fondly enough to build a wsb2.0 some day
1404,Well I had a thanksgiving dono post removed with just 2 votes and I got the auto-message from the bot confirming so...
1405,"Focus on education, rather than punishment.   A lot of people get banned because they're unfamiliar with the sub, which is completely understandable given how fast we've grown.   You can expect to see more in the coming days, but we'll be a bit busy with the holidays. (Plus, markets are closed, how busy could WSB be?)  WSB Vote Bot was meant to be a way to find and onboard new mods. Hopefully there's a list of the top contributors floating around somewhere."
1406,Perfect legal as long as it's disclosed.
1407,"That’s always the risk of selling to lock in profits though. And like I said you can always buy right back in if it hits the strike, unless it’s a crazy short squeeze where it rockets past the $30 and you literally can’t buy back in near there."
1408,"If Cohen is really going to turn GME around, this dip wouldn't matter. Relax."

1412,"Huh, seems like something that shouldn't be.  Hold my moscow mule, Imma open a spazzy spac."
1413,"Sadly WSB has been declining for a while now. We've gotten to the point where people genuinely believe holding a massive position in GME is reasonable. I mean, we've always been retarded, but wholly fuck those are new levels of austitic"

1415,All calls expire on Friday.

1424,WSB sucks now anyways. Now its painfully cringe normie trash
1425,I thought every new DD post gets pinned?
1426,"WSB 2.0, like USB 2.0, faster and I am sure there is something else it does that's cool"
1427,F
1428,"Yes, I know that. So he basically used us as puppets to get his max gains while we get scraps. The ""gmegang"" were pushing the agenda over and over that shares were better than options."
1429,"Lol I’m all in on steel and watching my account bleed, will probably bleed until Q1. Closing broker"
1430,"I think the real question is, will he exercise his options for 100k shares @ 1mil cost basis??"
1431,Yeah yeah don't let the door hit you in the pussy on the way out.  WSB is greater than any one man
1432,"Are you oblivious to the irony here? You told me to relax, but I'm the one holding. You don't have to tell me, tell your paper-handed friends. Lol"
1433,I've been bag holding AMD calls all week. Currently down 39% and that shit hurts. It doesn't expire till Feb 19th tho. but still oof
1434,also small chance amd will have hand designing chips
1435,"Boomers here probably remember the great exodus from Digg to Reddit. The time is ripe for the next one. Someone has to build a platform where people aren't banned for ""toxicity"", ""hate speech"", or other bullshit, but is still properly moderated from low quality content.  Puts on plebbit. Calls on the future billionaire autist who pulls this off."
1436,Sounds like WSBgod all over again
1437,All new DD posts get pinned until another comes along.  It's just normal bot behavior.
1438,I stopped visiting r/mma for a couple of months and it literally didn’t change at all. Same lame copy pasta’s and even same opinions. It wouldn’t surprise me if half the sub were bots
1439,Who cares this shit isn’t about ego just get with the times and buy gme fds
1440,Guess it’s time to go back to posting stupid shit on r/options
1441,We should just drop DD in the comments section of pornhub videos. It’s the platform we most have in common. Most of us are split screen anyways.
1442,who tf has the time to actively mod an internet forum? seems like the pool of candidates would be limited to high schoolers and bums tbh
1443,"Wait, are we inviting Cramer?"
1444,"If you are thinking of FOMOing in, buy Lightning eMotors (GigCapital3) warrants and hold for six months. You'll do a lot better with less downside risk. Basically the same company but they have a partnership with $PLUG and their vehicle production is already in full swing, and 100% of their 2021 revenue guaranteed in writing (contracts for vehicle orders). They do everything XL Fleet does but are further along in development, and are currently trading as a derivative of XL fleet so you still get some near-term upside."
1445,They’re powered by magnets
1446,OK FINE   ILL ACCEPT TO BE A WSB MOD   😈😈😈🔥🔥😈🔥🔥😈😈  ALL PENIS POST WILL HE ALLOWED
1447,Ok somebody make it happen   r/LUVS2FUKSTONKS

1450,That said I made good tendies off his NVDA $420 1/21 call
1451,Fuzzy wuzzy wasn’t very fuzzy?  Was he?
1452,I bought some calls a few months ago 17.5c Jan and 15c May holding a lil 280 shares been buying since $10 watching the options gains made me just buy some calls was happy with the lil $7500 gain got today
1453,If you can't spell it you can't afford it
1454,"Hi. I'm PLTR, have we met?"
1455,Where do sell puts for r/wallstreetbets? Asking for a friend.
1456,"yea but in my opinion that's mostly a side effect of the spiteful fat girl syndrome that's taking over America  eventually someone's gonna figure out how to give people exercise and calorie restriction in the form a pill and then we are gonna have our next industrial revolution, so its all good just chill until then"
1457,"Can't rape the willing, and by the looks of things, it wouldn't be the first time for a lot of us here."
1458,"Fuzzy comment. As many of you know I was a mod and contributor to the community before I stepped away because of the direction of the sub and my differing views on what we should be trying to promote here. Notwithstanding my personal views on /u/zjz and his style of moderating, he worked very hard and was definitely the driving force behind many cool WSB innovations. Big loss"
1459,Wish upon a star and it might happen
1460,All natural
1461,Thanks mom I made it myself
1462,Couldn’t have put it better myself. Great username by the wat
1463,"Nah, it would just accelerate their transition to renewables."
1464,Omg it was an excalibur test.
1465,Oh well this place was spiraling the drain even with him around I had one foot out the door already ✌️
1466,Eh I mean I know this whole sub is long so this will get downvoted to shit but GME is literally nothing but a WSB orchestrated short squeeze and probably is going to $0 in the long run. Seriously is there single person on this sub that has spent any money at GameStop this year or even plans to next year? You literally can download any game to your Xbox or PS5 without leaving your house.
1467,"So his max loss isn’t 100%. What am I saying, risk management is for virgins."
1468,God fucking damn it - I just want to lose money and shitpost. Why the fuck do we have to go through a perestroika every 6 months?
1469,“WSB does not equal after ZJZ left.” What the fuck are you tryin’ to say??
1470,A guy trying to profit off WSB which is pretty much what everyone here is doing every day. Main difference is he started the sub.
1471,No it just begs for people to karma farm. Actually moderating is the only cure.
1472,Oh damn I didn’t realize that was swineflupandemic. Good mod.  Was stormwillpass part of the shilling or did he just quit to get out of the drama?
1473,Glad to see I’m not the only one betting on GOEV
1474,"I mean some of the positions after tsla would have made you money especially when he ""went"" into puts. But you'd also have to hate money to not have puts at that point."
1475,New DD posts are automatically pinned.
1476,"Please come back, I need more well written DD to read only to miss the whole point and make the wrong bet."
1477,"We can’t put our good plays on here anyway, all of Cramers boomers about to start crawling in here and in all seriousness having bigger companies look into this sub will only mean they will start trying play us with fake posts"
1478,If you want to manage your risk you just buy fewer calls. Debit spreads implies that he thinks it wont go past $35 a share.
1479,[Richard Feyman on Magnets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8)
1480,Well I have. I got a switch download space is super limited &amp; I want physical copies so I can install and uninstall &amp; play whatever I want whenever the mood hits me. I don't actually see physical copies disappearing this cycle. Like how do you rap a download for christmas? Mom is buyin you a physical copy to put under the tree dog.
1481,I believe he also was trying to get some wallstreetbets arena games bullshit to happen as well
1482,"and just when i really started using this sub. this some bullshit  well if yall retards move somewhere else, let me know"
1483,"It’s only rapey if they say no, which they won’t cause of the implication"
1484,Who would’ve thought so much drama and shit would happen over a free message board in which the mods spend hours upon hours earning $0 to shovel our shit on behalf of a multi billion dollar corporation lining their pockets.  All Reddit mods are fucking actual retards.
1485,PH is trash right now too though
1486,/u/zjz why don't we just make a new sub. /r/autistleaps
1487,You know it
1488,Equal is the same therefore Wall Street bets isn’t the same after he left
1489,We definitely need to diversify where we all hangout. Reddit isn't necessarily the most free platform for the kind of language we use and ideas we express. It would be nice to be included in the .win community or have an irc to fall back to or even a discord.
1490,"don't worry scro', there's plenty of tards out there living real kick-ass lives"
1491,No.   Can you and zjz and the other old schoolers start an ACTUAL wallstreetbets sub that we neophytes have to perform dangerous and possibly homoerotic stunts to join?  I've lurked here since December last year. I've been actively following since February.  I've heard the legends from the oldschoolers about what WSB used to be.  I'm sorry I didn't discover it sooner. I'd like the chance to atone for my mistakes.  Pleas Reddit again.
1492,You doubted the market makers powers; now you see? They crashed our sub
1493,"And he waltzes in, just like that.  When are you going to retire and publish your tell-all book?  I'm tired of reading disappointing literature."

1507,"nah, but it's always an option!"
1508,Good looks I’ll check it out might wait for a dip
1509,i looked at stocktwits the other day and that shit is so obviously astroturfed it's ridiculous.
1510,"Look at OXY's Yahoo page, some dude named Mehmet has been spamming that for months almost everyday with 6+ generic white name alt accounts thinking he's going to tank the stock price or something. Guy is more retarded than WSB somehow."
1511,"Lol this sub has way too many drama for being a retarded as fuck place.  Being a mod is a thankless job, especially if you do it well - so I guess GG to zjz and thanks for all the fish."
1512,All that sub has become is a giant hate boner for Dana. The only fun thing about it are the live fight threads
1513,Doesn’t wsb have a discord already?
1514,"its impossible. people love their echo chambers. i promise you the ""normie"" redditor doesnt give a shit someone got banned for saying a gamer word.  reddit is actually fairly free, relatively speaking by the admins actions. the problem is posting wrongthink in a sub will get you downvoted to hell, and, on certain subs, outright banned by the volunteer mods. but admins generally have been good about letting all views on the site as long as they adhere to the rules.   (dont try to bring up TD, they self-destructed themselves after flaunting the rules for 3 years)"

1526,"Here's what always happens:  - Seasoned experts create forum/hangout/whatever to discuss strategies and ideas - Other people find this forum and it grows - Eventually it's filled primarily with newbies and idiots who don't understand what made the place great in the first place - Corporate interests take note of large amounts of people and start monetizing it. In this case, it's the financial sharks who hang target newbie retards with pump and dumps, trading courses and other snake oil - The natives leave and the original magic is lost  This phenomenon happens everywhere without fail. I don't know the solution. All I know is this place has been colonized by retards and I'm a sad indian watching the elders leave."
1527,"I agree with a lot you say, but I am pretty extreme when it comes to freedom on the internet. I believe that even dumb subs like incels and anti-vax deserve to be here. Not that I agree with them, but to protect people's ability to discuss no matter what their ideas are."

1558,"&gt;Corporate interests take note of large amounts of people and start monetizing it. In this case, it's the financial sharks who target newbie retards with pump and dumps, trading courses and other snake oil  Which is what 99% of the job is. You shill ""x trading academy"" and you are instantly banned. P&amp;Ds are combatted with market cap and penny stock requirements which were removed by the bot. People bitch about it, but it's a whole hell of a lot better if we didn't have it. The beauty of the sub is that the gawkers who want to jump in normally get washed out in a year tops. This isn't /r/cringe where the sub just jumps the shark and nobody knows what the original point of the sub was.   &gt;All I know is this place has been colonized by retards and I'm a sad indian watching the elders leave.   This place has always been colonized by retards. Look at the posts from 5 years ago, same shit, just less people. The sub is objectively better than it was in 2017."
1559,I don’t understand what’s happening. Can someone fill me in in 3rd grade level terms? Also $PENN to the moon
1560,Oh wow you can’t wrap a download for Christmas I totally didn’t think of that. GME to $100 guys.

1567,Thankless especially here where we call the mods gay ALL THE TIME. Some mods do work real hard and care a lot

1569,"If you're a hedge fund that went balls deep in shorting GME, then a bunch of aspies flood with with weekly OTM calls, you'll do whatever it takes to gtfo"
1570,And the tragedy is that the sub has lost its faggboy finance bro shtick. Now it’s just low effort “wife’s boyfriend” and “autist” lines repeated ad nauseam. This place needs to get back to prime shit post status...

1574,"I'm going all in. Which isn't much more than I already have in, but it's another 1.2k,so let's fly!"
1575,The mods really are gay as aids.
1576,"There's a subreddit that makes satire comics about countries that keeps quality up by literally maintaining a whitelist of the _only_ people allowed to submit things.  If you aren't on that list, your post is automatically removed. To get on the list, you have to make something funny and send it to the mods. If the mods like it, they can add you and let you submit stuff.  The subreddit also will ban anyone that references it from another subreddit, in order to help keep noobs out (which is why I'm being fairly vague). It's honestly done a great job in keeping the sub manageable... but also requires the mods to be up to date on manually approving users to post."
1577,The mods are all gay homo’s.
1578,Retarded Elmo has entered the chat.

1587,"Mods are 🌈, we established this in 2004"
1588,"Kinda weird how that works out and I never understood it here. You can’t take much seriously on this sub and if you do, you are in the wrong place.   Being a mod of a sub like this size is pretty much having a second job. And you don’t get paid and when something goes wrong users want to hang you."
1589,Yahoo finance comment section is insane.  That place is completely dysfunctional and toxic.  The bears and bulls on a given stock organize into factions and have long running shitposting feuds with each other.  It’s a real weird atmosphere.  Like an older and somehow less sophisticated crowd than wsb.
1590,You're a dumb ass
1591,Who was that other mod that we all ended up hating this year? I forgot their name. They got banned from here I think and haven’t posted since on their account. I’m assuming they are back under an alt account or something.

1607,Sooooo... Are we still riding the steel train?
1608,So.... will $MT still win bigly?
1609,Should have read it in Jeff Daniels’ voice probably.
1610,"Solution imo: flair things should say how long people been in the sub. Times with big influx of noobs should have limits on them commenting or posting. New people should not be allowed to comment more than once or twice in a day - most of them dont trade and just copy paste basic comments. Its like the actual retards of reddit who go around making a pyramid of ""nice nice nice"" comments for years on end."

1613,wsb is already flooded with idiot normies so it won't change that much
1614,300 shares and an assortment of calls here. I fuckin love spreads and this play (forehead slap) hadn’t even occurred to me. If I can get this filled tomorrow I’m picking up 200.
1615,well it's about as much of a problem as the fact that all living things die. sounds like a very natural lifecycle of... uh subreddits. lol
1616,Now that the corporate interests and finance firms have infiltrated we should all just vanish like the fucking Mayans.
1617,You're forgetting the 13yo trying to pump penny stocks that they've invested $10 into.

1621,"You joke, but I've seen it in the comments."
1622,"/r/zjz or people like him need to create a /r/wallstreetbets/ version of /r/expensivehumanfashion/.         /r/malefashionadvice became a cesspool of retards asking retard questions and people posting photos of them finally finding a normal-fitting sweater thinking they were a fashion icon. So, people created /r/expensivehumanfashion/. You need to apply and show a genuine interest in fashion to be accepted. Whether that be through the application or your previous Reddit posts.         The same exact thing needs to happen. There needs to be a /r/wallstreetbets/ that requires an application to get in. You need to show a history of risky trades, a passion for investing, or evidence that you aren't a fucking idiot in your application (""I worked on Wall Street, here's proof"" or ""I'm a student at Warton, here's proof"" or ""here's how basic game theory/options/behavioral finance/ etc. works and my thoughts on it"". It's tiring to see the same retarded posts on /r/wallstreetbets/ of people not understanding the most basic things. The subreddit is called ""Wall Street Bets"", it is for people who make risky bets who somewhat understand the risks, not for complete morons that don't even understand the basics of the bet they just made."

1631,"It's retarded that people here are offering ideas for improvement when this whole thing was prompted by a great mod that had to step aside. Those ideas won't be fully embraced until the drivers of this sub set their priorities straight (or gay, whatever) and align them with us, the people that just want to make some money or have fun trying."
1632,"That's love/acknowledgement from us to mods. Mods turning on each other is of course shitty. Unpopular opinion but ever since the mod who cannot be named left, things have been kinda messy. There would've been power grab behind the scenes which mods haven't told us yet."

I couldn't post a lot of undervalued SPACs near $10 because of the rule, for example, I got in R M G, P I C, N G A, etc all around $10.   Also called M A R A when it was $4 in a comment few weeks ago but it was under 1B so I didn't make a DD, netted 5000% return on my 8C Feb.   &amp;#x200B;  **Anyway, I will be posting my next DD very soon, follow for more (I didn't even know reddit followers was a thing)**"

1650,So. Fucking. Stupid.
1651,Was up 120% on some VXX puts at one point but apparently after going up like .20 after DECLINING ALL DAY is enough to wipe out the entirety of my gains
1652,"PLTR gonna pop overnight and fade all day tomorrow too, huh?"
1653,So what’s up with the dump at end? Is it because of the Trump veto?

1669,I am retarded. I bought 50 Spy calls with a strike of 369 expiring tomorrow for a scalp EOD but didn't realise it's already 4pm. Got them literally 2 seconds before the market closed and can't sell because I bought them in RH.

1690,Sold my 12/24 5x 369p when we were hovering around 369 for a .26 loss on each. Now sitting at 1.76 which would’ve been a .70 gain per. This was my 2nd day trade.  Rolled into 368p 12/24 on revenge to average down. Placed an order to sell all 20 for just above my cost. Cancelled right before they hit (but then 1 of the 20 went through) - my 3rd day trade. Now I’m up 50% on this play but I’m nervous af we’re gonna pump like always overnight and lose it all
1691,"1% gain today lol and closed some of my losing positions including my ACCD leaps and DASH puts. Otherwise didn't do much, a boring trading day for me.   All the things I like have shot up a lot recently, and I don't believe in chasing prices up since the market is volatile. So I'm on the sidelines until my next opportunity.

The ones that clowned me for saying my capital is better off on other plays than buying puts on a boomer company like AAPL (bc they said put up or shut up if you dont think AAPL will moon to like 200)?

1884,I can’t believe they closed all California stores. Sucks for sales!!!
1885,Just glanced at it. Looks like they closed out their previous loans and started up new ones. Basic cash flow management stuff. Probably got better terms thanks to new company size and low interest rates in general. Shouldn't mean much for share price.
1886,all it fuckin did today was flop like a fish
1887,Are they really gonna do this to me on Christmas ?
1888,Loaded to the tits msft calls 💯
1889,I believe if the option expires ITM your shares will get called away at $33 and you still keep the premium. So you only the shares in the process. Someone correct me if i’m wrong.

1990,His phone is probably dead by now with that battery
1991,Actually GME is one of the worst performing things in my portfolio and picking up a lot of capital because people were selling this $500+ squeeze. The options are up more than 1000% since i bought so definitely not going into those now.
1992,"Some models only have handles that pop out when you're close by with the key fob, I've seen lots of posts from people complaining about them getting frozen shut or just simply not working because they're fucky."
1993,A smart retard would have bought GME weeklies .
1994,"To be honest I'm okay with it because I needed to free up some funds to buy MVIS, I have way more faith in them longterm than GME."
1995,"In an absolute sense, for many people, shares are probably better than options just because it's so difficult to time options. If they expire worthless, you lose everything whereas shares never expire unless the company goes bankrupt. It boils down to your risk tolerance. You can still jump in options now."
1996,I closed mouse options for $5 gain cuz I didn’t “like my position” and then it ran up and I missed out on making thousands.
1997,"I mean, many people are in this for the short squeeze. Not sure I'd risk the potential for 1000% gains by selling calls on GME because you don't know when the squeeze will happen."
1998,"shit, that turtle better have a neck like a giraffe if it wants a piece of this."
1999,C
2000,You still have to set a price target at some point.  Otherwise you are going to hold through the squeeze and just miss out.  By repeatedly selling covered calls I’ve gotten my cost basis below $10 now.
2001,This is insider trading or he is a dumb ass but made it
2002,The fact that the position was never in the green for a single second 🤡

2010,"Let's say you are a Michaelaneglo and make a beautiful piece of art out of $1000 worth of material.   Someone offers you $2000 for it.  Would you sell it? You fucking know you are MICHAEL FUCKING ANGELO.  You ain't selling for anything less than what you already had in mind.   DFV has held onto his belief that his long thesis was correct 2 years ago.   He's not selling until April when his final options expire.  It's not about the money.  It's about vindication.   If he was concerned about the money, he would use his cash and continue to squeeze this to infinity.   But he hasn't increased his position since this started climbing up."
2011,Was for a few seconds
2012,Oh fuck. They're really hedging their stock shorts with *puts*?? So now they're not only going to owe shares but a fuck ton of money.   This is going to be the most massive wealth redistribution event in history.
2013,I'd bet that's his end game.  He hasn't increased his position these past few days.  He obviously isn't concerned about maximizing profit.   Looks like he's just seeking vindication.
2014,Are people retarded? They opened the position at the same time. It's a fucking spread.  You wouldn't really know if it's a debit or credit too - but probably a debit spread given GME pricing.

2060,"Damn, you're beating the system!"
2061,Its just Financial Diligence but people get tired of typing that shit out so they shortened it to FD  same reason they are called LEAPs etc etc etc
2062,"If you click his username and read his older posts it will provide insight and also amusing to see the comments he was getting back then.  Basically, in the land before time GME was like $4 and everyone thought it was total shit (it mostly is).  Lots of people were betting against it by shorting shares.  But they actually have a lot of money saved up even if they are currently flailing around, enough that they are actually worth more than $4/share just based on assets and shit.  Now it's November.  New consoles are coming out, poorly performing stores are being closed, an activist investor is buying up shares and trying to change the business model.  So things are looking somewhat up, and the people shorting it are getting further underwater and the amount of shares they can actually buy are limited.  OP saw all this in advance (except maybe ryan cohen) and has been waiting to pounce."
2063,He won't sell..for the sake of us to have a god to look up to
2064,I'm sure it was more of a cost thing for Elon because Lidar was quite expensive compared to radar. Luckily Lidar sensors are getting cheaper and perhaps will be put on Tesla vehicles in the future but who knows.
2065,Always makes me wonder when people buy these 0 dte contracts do they actually look at break even price? Fuuuuckin hell
2066,"I'm long gme as well, but if you are worried about this dip, then maybe you should have been ""paper handed"" as well, as you are clearly emotional about this stock / too deep.  No one is going to look out for you, and crying about paper handers driving the price down while you are left bag holding won't change the fact that you are poor now and they secured gains.  That being said, GME will only keep going up."
2067,"Can I give you 100,000?   I just want a million back"
2068,"I mean if you read all the columns he already has $1,000,000 in cash in this account."
2069,Choke on your turkey you worm. Cash out before it expires worthless.
2070,Just read some of the comments on his posts from a year ago about GME. Let’s just say they did not age well...
2071,A $10 call when the stock is already $20 is an easy sell?  It's already in the money.  Especially since everyone is now expecting it to go further up.
2072,"Ring the damn register!  Roll the options up!  You can add more contracts to keep the same delta while taking capital off the table.  Seriously, do it.  You will not be upset when you are liquid.  You do know that you'll have to liquidate over multiple weeks, right? You control what is the equivalent of 252k shares.  You could roll it all up (without the shares) to the April $20s and take $143k off the table and gain additional leverage if it continues running."
2073,They’re going to need a full 3 pages if they plan on showing his big diamond balls
2074,Lol 10k was enough to do long trades and profit substantially. Nice blow up. A true legend you are.
2075,"Where was I crying exactly? My point was the paper hands caused the dip they feared which perpetuated more panic sell off. It was a negative feedback loop that I called out for what it was, a result of their own fear. I'm unsure how my resilience could be misunderstood as emotional, but this place is known for water heads so feel free to carry on."
2076,That it expires on the 24th of December

2092,"Seriously, I don't know shit and even I noticed the RSI on lots of stuff like Apple was way overbought."
2093,From the flat chart it looks like you just deposited 10k and then proceeded to lose it all in a single day on a 0DTE?  Why do this?
2094,[The gay bears right now.](https://i.imgflip.com/4rhpln.jpg)
2095,I'm new. So because they're ITM it will convert to stocks? And normally when a call expires you lose the money and thus have to sell before it expires?
2096,This sub is psychotic amd it's contagious. I completely read that statement as if it was normal.
2097,JPM price target is currently under $90 I believe.
2098,That’s my annual income in a day.....🤡
2099,So what is DeepFuckingValues story about why he first invested and held on for so long?  And where does he see GME going? I’d love to know if he’s riding this short selling boat to the moon also or if he is planning to cash out
2100,"I don't know, stocks can go up or down. Anything is possible, but I hope Tesla branches out more. For example, acquire a genome research company and create electric super soldiers. Or put up more satellites and add orbital bombardment capabilities. Maybe acquire Palantir and along with the satellites, create actual Skynet."
2101,Does your broker automatically calculate this cost basis reduction or do you have to keep track of it yourself in a spreadsheet?
2102,Didn’t notice the last column was cash on hand.  I feel better.  Though still amazed at the holding.  I’d be slamming my finger on the sell button looking at those numbers on options no less.  But guess thats why that is his account balance not mine.
2103,I've done CCs on GME 3 times in a month. Once at earnings and twice last week in the same week. Doubled my shares on margin so I wouldn't miss the ride up and still whiffed on about .60 of gains including premiums.  I think if you're getting crazy high IV premium rates it's worth considering. But it's very easy to miss the boat. If anything be prepared to double down on your shares after hours.
2104,It's a weekly until Thursday. OP would have been way better off spending that 9k on the actual FDs. Watch it print.
2105,4 shares at $21.56. it ain't much but it's honest work
2106,"Jesus that was a stupid buy - then again, someone has to lose in this casino, better you than me."
2107,"Yeah, for us retards that no nothing, honestly what the fuk are leaps?"
2108,It's not that odd of a chance considering the stock has gapped up double digit % two mornings in a row. Also consider if something bad happens you may end up holding the shares well past a point where you may have exited.  It's an attractive strategy with a good chance to beat normal gains on a company with high premiums but it's not fool proof. Especially if you can't afford to double your position or sustain a large price dip.
2109,Glad you didn't sell today. Believe in him and Santa may get to you by 1pm. Did you buy more today?
2110,$30 isn't some crazy market cap. It's not even near their ATH price.
2111,I'm glad I'm eating my words on GME. I don't know how the fuck they're surviving COVID and non-existent console sales but they're doing their best.
2112,"At the time I had 300 shares. Bought 100 more when it dipped under $13, and another 50 on Monday. GME Gang"

2127,Trump brought this market to where it is today. He will bring it down with him. Congrats to the people that supported sleepy joe.
2128,crazy stupid question...I have a Dec 24 option contract via Etrade that I was planning to close before 1 PM close tomorrow. But etrade just pinged me my option expired (auto notification). I assumed a Dec 24 call expires on Dec 24 at market close...whuts da deal
2129,today sucked. took profits too early. missed out on making so much more today. yeeted my phone across the room and broke it. not a great day. but like idk i feel like fkn pathetic for even being mad for taking profits early. just wanted to get my account back in the green by eoy.

2153,"Apple gonna release a new special edition $2,000 iPhone just in time for stimmy."
2154,If PLTR is at or above $33 when your calls expire you will get assigned to sell 100 shares times however many contracts you sold. If you want to keep your shares you have to buy however many calls you sold at the $33 strike. Definitely do not sell 400 shares in an attempt to close your positions as that is not at all how this works. You should learn more about how options work before you play with them again

2217,I bought spy calls end of day. We can’t sell into Christmas. It’s Christmas!  (RIP me.)
2218,He also called Nkla a clown car which should be its trade ticker
2219,"Sir, this is a Wendy's"
2220,Is there going to be another mass ban again? What will I do all day? Work?
2221,AAPL is ghey
2222,"bigly red markets is very bullish for GME, GME boys  looks like my lotto tickets are expiring worthless :("
2223,Guys my DD is scrolling this sub once a day
2224,Wonder who it was hmmmm.... ;)
2225,Mine might as well be a pride flag
2226,so I can close my position tomorrow?? this is the first time I’ve had a notification like this from E-trade. Sometimes they give you a heads up regarding soon to expire options but this said expired
2227,Shame. That's a lot of work you spent on that stat page and the bots we can tell.
2228,interesting... maybe I'll do that as well. Still pretty safe right? TSLA might drop I'm a little worried
2229,F
2230,Appreciate you trying. That guy is a major douche and is power hungry.
2231,Is Addison Rae going to be mod now like pokimane was?
2232,"Mods longing $ROPE, it all comes full circle"
2233,All SPAC warrants behave this way. The gap won’t close until the merge has happened and warrants can be exercised (usually like 30 days after merge)  They’re pricing in the risk the share price corrects between now and then
2234,If the calls you sold get exercised you dont do anything. Whoever bought your calls receives the shares automatically. There’s something called the Options Clearing Corporation that handles all of this along with your broker as far as i understand
2235,Fuck. I'm worried about what I'm going to do the 25th to the 28th.  Can't we just work holidays on WS?
2236,Let’s go picked up some calls on it today
2237,Doggy and missionary. It was just a quickie
2238,I really really need tomorrow to be green so I can make more money
2239,Nearly a 100% day. I don't think I've ever seen that before on a stock 😮
2240,Pressing F to pay respects     *F*
2241,"Last time we had a short day GME mooned 15%, just saying"
2242,"Plenty of people are hungry, even in absurdly rich countries like ours."
2243,Are you long this option? And you sure the expiration is 12/24 and not a SPY 12/23 option? What ticker and strike is it anyways? The only way something can just expire if you are long is you exercise an OTM option early but I'm sure you didn't do that.
2244,Just got a bunch of warrants for stic.    May sell some mt since I am pretty deep in it and roll to other things
2245,"Thanks for all the work you put in to this community, God knows how hard it can be wrangle us idiots"
2246,"It’s the low volume, it doesn’t really matter"
2247,"i feel like we’ll open, maybe 368 but slow bleed all day. short trading day, three day weekend, end of year. there’s bound to be some profit taking happening tomorrow.  with that said, spy 400 EOY"
2248,"Hey man, thanks for all of your work and effort. Fuck them. Focus on yourself from now on and live for the best."

2254,"All the big gainers today are penny stocks and aftermarket the biggest gainers are also penny stocks , did all the tiktok robinhood kids just discovered stocks under $1."
2255,Agreed. Defense budget has been egregiously too big for a long fucking time
2256,"So like, are we fucked?"
2257,I beefed with u zjz but u did a good job keeping the sub clean RIP
2258,thought we are only getting 600 but republicans want the 2k check? a bit out of the loop but that's what's i have gathered from briefly hearing about it. Could very well be dead wrong
2259,"Damn. So much drama on a sub where we’re all just trying to get rich. There’s already tons of shills here, can’t imagine what it’ll be like unmoderated."
2260,I'd like to buy into cocaine commodities in NY. WS probably doinked sideways this week. Marry Crimbus rich kids.
2261,"I got so royally fucked by silver with some way too much leveraged derivates on the dip a few months back. Traumatic memories, ain't ever touching JPM's hyper-manipulated little toy-thing ever again."
2262,Found out Santa isn't real.
2263,Low volume/liquidity.
2264,"Sorry buddy. Also, you’re gay"
2265,"That’s like a 20% gain, that’s a lot"
2266,I'm going to sit out of a high volitaloty environment said no one ever that likes money
2267,"Fuck. :(. I don’t want this sub to go completely to shit. For what it’s worth, I appreciate your work. You are merely bisexual, not totally gay like the other mods."
2268,I just want WBA to 🚀🚀🚀 so my calls can make some money 💰
2269,are you a girl?
2270,Why has wsb gotten dumber lately?
2271,We’re gonna open up tomorrow down like -0.5%   If you’re holding 0DTE you are most likely fucked but otherwise everyone calm down   This was so expected. Did you not hear him give his speech yesterday?? HE LITERALLY SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO THIS.  —&gt; Priced in. Fuck bears.
2272,First my calls die and the last good subreddit is going to die now to shitposters.   Merry fucking Christmas 🎄
2273,This world isn't real...
2274,Somehow my account is up 20% today and for once it doesn't feel like I'll lose it all tomorrow
2275,"Alright boys need a new recommendation I got in on nio, PLTR, and mgni all pretty early what’s next"
2276,You should post DDs that are banned here on your profile.
2277,Are nkla puts the move?
2278,Stay at home stocks finally went down for a day.
2279,"Hey man I respect the hell out of what you've done. Take some time off, this isn't supposed to be a job."
2280,You're probably getting a heads up
2281,It’s not that far off if you factor in their ability to bring your food via warp speed technology they must have invented.
2282,Here’s a downvote instead
2283,So I took a big nap and woke up just now. Why did SPY and most stocks drop near the end?
2284,Hit /r/all too many times
2285,"If it means anything, we had a similar situation in /r/cryptocurrency  Our top mod and his cohort didn't post anything for literally 2 years, we had to do a reddit request to finally pry his cold dead corpse off of the sub  Honestly, moderating is a thankless job most of the time but if you do it you do it for the community, not for any head moderator. If the dude's inactive it doesn't really matter unless there's other weirdness going around, the active mods run the place"
2286,Damn man. I’m sad. You’re a good.
2287,yep was a long position for 12/24. I’m hoping I’m just retarded and my order to close the position expired at market close rather than the actual contract.
2288,"This is what I worry, back when gartech was here I was swept up in a mass ban for a few months :("
2289,A what?
2290,Gme 17p and pltr 30c for shit and googles or bye $200. It’s not real money. 🤡
2291,Because it is massively shorted?
2292,We are so fucked
2293,2017-2020 was quite the time. Sad to see what it is today
2294,Every stock tip I get is a goddamn SPAC
2295,Everyone hating on my 1/15 MT call post are cucks. I thought this was a gambling sub but it’s literally only pussies
2296,idk wtf im doing but as a wise man once said yolo
2297,Hahah got into stic warrants ah just now instantly goes up 2% I'll take it
2298,Whole market dumped but fuck apple this week in particular. That stupid ass rumor was just to inflate their price going to years end and it fucked so much shit up.
2299,Lots of bots and schills on here now along with a ton of new people
2300,Uh-oh another J@RTEK situation
2301,"Strike and ticker?  It has to be the latter where your order expired. Another way to check is go to orders page and look at the category that says like ""expired"" and see if your order appears there."
2302,"Yes, this place becomes over run with trash when good mods die and automods are shut off."
2303,When I have a child I will get them a brokerage account when they are 4 and their $0.75 allowance will go directly into it so they can yolo penny stocks.
2304,Why did tech stocks shit the bed at 3:55pm??  Edit: it's because I looked away from the screen for a few minutes. Sorry guys.
2305,"Anyone else like seeing the market as a whole perform poorly, to feel like you “did better” than the market and actually have skill?"

2324,Don’t get salty now
2325,Bought all the spy calls I could in the last seconds of the day in preparation for tomorrow’s no volume flatness.

2341,"The are basically electric bottoms with tops that can be switched out depending on what you want (delivery van, family car, etc). Basically like a skateboard with a car body on top.

2343,"Man I didn't even see the dip, I was taking a shit and then when I was done I had lost all my money"

2356,so what were the plays td?
2357,Family is back in Lebanon. 2nd year in a row I don’t celebrate Christmas with them. Cheers to my fam. Hoping I can leave 2021 with a bag because of this sub
2358,"I know, we need a list of some of the more active here and we can go fuck off until things get normal/modded"
2359,Wsb is going to go to shit the same week the market crashed rip mods rip my boy the s&amp;p
2360,So sad. I anticipate it goes private again.
2361,Why there got to be so much drama in mod teams man...
2362,"My pp was already flaccid thanks to XPEV and NIO yesterday, but got into my tummy today. Am I a woman now?"
2363,Then I can't help
2364,"Hope so, I’m down 40% on my puts.  Need a 30% drop tomorrow"
2365,"No it'll be 27k taxable income and you pay taxes on that amount (which you should've already paid from your job from withholding so you'll get small overall refund probably around 1k). You'll be able to carry over 47k of losses for next year but it can only be used to offset income up to 3k total every year. More than 3k can be used to offset capital gains though (a bit more complicated but let's say you made 47k trading next year, then you can claim a 0 gain in trading next year). If you have a tax application it does it automatically, including the carryover loss.   If you think it's that easy then that's like saying if a person makes 0 dollars income from a job (no job) but lost X on trading, he/she should expect to get X back from my refund using your logic which obviously doesn't happen since that's a freeroll."
2366,Santa..... Isn't..... Real?!?!  😭😭😭
2367,I'll say it again ARK R has about a two year window before it looks like every other ARK
2368,Imagine doing all the TA and focused abt 12/24 368P since I was  expecting ES to reject its backtest  at 3695 but then sold off at break even just before close worried abt a sudden late ramp as the sell off wasn’t happening  and the next minute dump happens and you lose 100% potential gain just by selling 1 min early ..  Phew .. I hate this ..
2369,There’s a few of us around these parts
2370,"About $600 gains today, invested 100 shares apple, 50 shares AMD, 50 shares SPY, 300 shares QQQJ, 700 shares PLTR and sold 4 weekly contracts for PLTR strike price $33. Should be a fun week next week!"
2371,So I averaged down my 12/28 SPY 371 calls to $0.81. Hoping to break even or limit my losses tomorrow. Am I fucked? I just need it to go to 369.
2372,Pop up mt so I can buy my stuff!!
2373,As someone who does online advertising for a living. Taboola is big but an absolute piece of shit to work with last couple years. But i love spacs so fuck it im in.
2374,Just don’t be greedy. Sell deep out the money.   Like TSLA is not going to hit below $600 in one day.   Worst case scenario you have to buy it back for a few hundred more than you sold it for and roll it to a lower strike.  OR just get assigned and IMMEDIATELY sell the shares.  You literally can not lose unless you purposefully act retarded and sell shit too close in the money/ get greedy/ don’t pay attention to price movement
2375,Absolutely. Makes me feel like a real retard.
2376,It’s fucking retarded. You basically buy land for a VR version of Earth. I dumped a couple hundred into it for the meme potential of it and I’m up 150% on it
2377,Brother no!  All mods are 🌈🌈 but not you.
2378,bought puts for bac for next week hoping to see red on this for tomorrow and will back calls again .
2379,Sub is gonna get fucked up. The discussion has actually been pretty good in here lately with responses and reasonable questions and shit imo. Shills and scammers flood the sub with burner accounts and make it impossible to tell what’s up.
2380,Even an autist is right once in a while
2381,Anyone think BB still has more room to fall? I’m predicting ~$6.50 within the next 30 days.
2382,"High calf insertions so no point, already fcked"
2383,those are extremely ugly. I might buy puts on aesthetics alone
2384,Hope my calls finally explode before I have to sell them off at a loss.
2385,I bet the panties drop so ez
2386,yay no mor gay mods  &amp;#x200B;  wait who will take care of us children?  &amp;#x200B;  we have special needs!!!  halp
2387,Sorry to hear that they’re so far away. Hopefully technology can help bring you guys together. I too hope you can end the year with a banger of tendies!🤞🏻
2388,OSU guy is a mod?
2389,Guys a fuckin clown but at least if he’s bullish you know he has a large position and will pump it
2390,"Yeah man, we’re fucked. This guy did a lot."
2391,What can we do to fuck up this rogue mod? I’ll nuke my main calling him a phagg if need be
2392,We all got to retire sometime. Go on and be proud
2393,Oh shit lol I didn’t know that. I only get on here to use the discussion thread. And I basically live in this bitch
2394,Got one earlier in the day.... question is... will it print or flop. Eod dump was nice for it but not near enough to make it print
2395,Goodluck my friend.  Calls or puts idc.  I just hope we all make money 🙏🏾
2396,You make more money with weeklies but you have to get the timing right. Monthlies with Delta .3 are pretty safe
2397,Adjusted my portfolio a bit.  I've got 17k in Jan 2022 leaps.  ICLN 30C (largest position)  FSLR 120C  AMD 100C  BABA 300C  QCOM 150C  BA 260C  AAL 20C  NCLH 30C  17k in cash to DCA into these bad boys if necessary.
2398,Remember when WSBGOD was a thing and then got exposed as fake hood times
2399,"Don’t think so, just way active though"
2400,Ah I see. You missed blastoff basically.
2401,They are even mods I don’t think lol I just see comments time to time that are funny
2402,bout to be a blood bath for calls tomorrow isnt it..?
2403,"What does limit up mean? I know it means go up, but what exactly does it mean?"
2404,"Been playing PLTR for 2 months. It’s popped on Friday and kept going up that day a rare amount of times. Probability wise, it’s going down tomorrow. If it doesn’t, even better."
2405,"Mods crying about who is in charge/more in charge of a subreddit lul, they should worry aobut the wait time for the damn drive thru im waiting like 15 gawd damn min for my fking frosty get it together guys"
2406,"Since it seems like the “royal” approach to moderation is not working very well, how about we democratize it?  Have all the candidates make a post detailing their plans and goals for the sub and then hold an election where only people that have been subbed for 1 year+ can vote. Maybe even weight user’s votes by the amount of years they have been here. 1 year gets 1 vote, 2 years gets 2 etc."
2407,"Virtue signaling for sure, but to be honest, FB does make a lot of money from small business promotion."
2408,Too many perma bulls that can’t put a logical sentence together and just spam and cry if we are not mooning 5% daily
2409,Why did everything take a crap into the close? Seriously. No GME comments plz.
2410,Show now mercy! The one bear you let live may end up becoming the next hitler!
2411,Nah hes mod just checked the WSB about
2412,You can't buy penny stocks on RH.
2413,SPY literally dropped half a percent immediately when u/zjz announced he was leaving.
2414,"I'm willing to become a mod here for 1,000 a week.  No less."
2415,no you can't deduct more than 3k
2416,"For what its worth, you have a reliable source of write offs for the next decade"
2417,"Foreigner here, is the 2k cheques a republican demand? I sounds like a more democrat demand."
2418,"Yep. You win some you lose some. It is a good way to generate extra money, though.  Sometimes I sell them 2 weeks out, but usually look for stuff ~6 weeks out and buy back once you're ~50% profit then sell another."
2419,Big is key
2420,Why anyone surprised trump vetoed a bill he said he would veto?
2421,Yeah the discussion turns to ass that’s the worst part. Zjz turned off mods for a few days in October and the sub was worthless pretty much
2422,This was my first time buying puts on anything and it feels great
2423,F
2424,Sometimes when I’m bored I just pick a ticker I see on here and buy the most retarded call possible. Today I chose vxx.
2425,All that for 600 lmao
2426,So what is the sentiment now about Apple. Time to dump or hold my 1/15 calls
2427,Imma go smoke a j and float to place where I don’t have to look at my negative earnings ✌️ see y’all tomorrow
2428,Can you make *me* a mod before you leave?
2429,Lmao I love that you edited it hahahaha
2430,No there is u/tsla500eod she’s a girl also but don’t ask her for market advise I don’t think she’s that good
2431,Lol hope you ain’t holding them still
2432,Market today was flatter than my sister.  Theres an internal mod civil war happening apparently.   Friday is Christmas which is a holiday.
2433,It’s a dead body bro
2434,"PLTR is a thirst trap, like all those insta thots taking slutty videos"
2435,Watching as APPL hits the low of the upper channel after hours before bouncing and going up again at open. God Damn after hours is where the money is made.  Also got that GME last minute call for super cheap.
2436,Him and /u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR are the only two i care about.
2437,"All you gay bears, fuck you too.  Jk, some of my homies are 🌈🐻"
2438,Yo whatever happened to that “doctorate in emoji spam” guy. Used to see him all the time in here
2439,GOOG had two of the biggest technological breakthrough this year:  DeepMind and Waymo  Go long
2440,Dobby is a free elf.
2441,What is going on with the mods? Someone confirm they are still gay please
2442,Nice what kind of socks? I got a big pair of tube socks I could use or is that too much?
2443,"You my boy are sitting on a goldmine, ICLN finna go dummy as fuck I’m 350% on 30s holding still till March minimum"

2445,-7k today all UNREALIZED 💎👐
2446,"It's not the covid bill, but the defense bill (where he wanted section 230 repealed)"
2447,Right that makes sense. THanks for this. Any idea how much cash you need to have on hand to do this? Might need to sell a bunch of stuff to open up enough cash to do theta gang for something like TSLA
2448,"No not Mechafuckboy, hes the homie."
2449,Being mad when you lose thousands doesn't make you risk averse. It just makes you mad
2450,Nio will hit $51 tomorrow. Chart says so.
2451,"Looks at that GME max chart, I can smell the $50 share price, I just want to taste it now"
2452,Thought I was big brain with FB at open guess not lol
2453,BIG NIO VIBES tomorrow. EV power play cup and handle has been established
2454,Pretty sure the only reason stimulus got vetoed was so that Congress would be forced to work through Christmas.  The man's the devil... But he's not the dumbest mf devil.
2455,So WSB is about to be flooded with pump and dump tickers?
2456,Everyone here is on 3rd/4th accounts at this point lol doubt if many have technically been joined for a year
2457,Those of ya who did not buy square today  are gonna regret it big time.  When u see big hitters favorites like that go down   U buy any dip
2458,I want AOC to have my babies. I won’t be around much tho
2459,"It’s 70 today. So, I was running around in shorts &amp; a Santa hat trying to mindfuck myself into a Christmas mood.   I’ve always believed that you could start a New Years resolution at any time of the year.  Just start whatever the fuck it is and stick to it.   But I really feel as a country we need a New Year.   #SNOW $250 Hoe Hoe Hoe 🎅🏿"
2460,This place is gonna be fucking carnage very soon. More than it already is.
2461,A sad day for WSB
2462,Why did it take XL so long to move? The merger was yesterday
2463,"Good im prob gonna cash out my few GME and NIO and go full in on PLTR soon. I already bought the dip on Monday with PLTR, so doing ok. But I’m thinking this will be a good long term buy for the next few months, into 2021 and not just a quick flip."

2485,Why is it fake? I follow him on Twitter. He makes some decent plays.
2486,why... its a week ahead of where it was predicted. It needs to hit the lower channel and retest what was once resistance. But that stupid sexy volume from the i car rumor is going to give the next leg higher growth.
2487,"You need enough to buy 100 shares at the strike price  In case you get assigned   So strike price of $600 X 100 shares = $60,000  A contract one week out will sell for $500-$1,000  In 60 weeks or less you will double your money and then you can start selling 2 contracts a week, then 4, then 8, then lambos, rarris and strippers"

2497,"Watching financial news outlets try to explain GME price movement without saying “short squeeze” is pretty hilarious. Everyone knows why it’s moving, but admitting that it’s happening would be admitting that the market has some pretty jarring imperfections that create opportunities for massive manipulation. Again, the mental and linguistic gymnastics are hilarious."

2576,This sub has turned to unrecognizable shit in 20 minutes.
2577,Fuck this. Figure it out.   This sub is fucking awesome and helped me return a 5x on my port since this time last yr. It will democratize finance in due time.   You mods either need an acid trip in Joshua tree or a high level Molly roll to air your shit out. Either way do it for the 1.6M degens in this sub   Thank you for all your efforts

2588,Where’s the loss porn bruh  Post it with a picture of that house you planned on owning 🤡
2589,As a net number against ordinary income yes. But it can be used to offset more than that in capital gains.   It carries over though so you'll eventually get it back unless you just lose every year.  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-loss-carryover.asp
2590,So many families must have been destroyed because idiots went all in on shripple   love it
2591,Might be a good idea to switch AMD to TSM. Reason why is that it seems that ARM processors are going to be the thing now and TSM will do good whether it's AMD or ARM that wins out since they manufacture both. Also TSM stopped their bulk discounts which means there will be a hard increase in revenue from now on. Solid picks overall though.

2694,Right. I have made my calls before the ICar news and appreciate the volume it has put in at the higher levels.
2695,Trump wants the 2k but the republicans don't. Democrats have been wanting 2k since like March.
2696,I’ve had the opposite story. I had puts as a hedge for my calls in election time. When we gapped up I sold my calls and didn’t know what to do with my puts and vix calls. I decided to average down as vix kept decreasing and here we are now.
2697,"It’s like a badge of honor, huh?"
2698,This ain’t far off from the truth probably lol remember one of the mods drives a jeep plastered with rainbow stickers
2699,So spike in the morning and then sell off?
2700,"I just want to inform you that I won't be moderating in the future. Knowing this might happen, I didn't moderate in the past either.  But if I ever do moderate, I will ban you, dear reader. Yes, you in particular. You know what you did."
2701,Lol true.  But don’t waste your time on wondering why.  Ask 10 different people you’re gonna get 10 different answers.  It’s a good mystery thou.

2714,I hate that I agree. Especially because I have 372 calls but it's obvious anytime SPY flirts with 370 it immediately tanks.
2715,Yup.    Can't complain about the tendies...but that is one gigantic mountain of tendies XL has right now.

2721,"Saaaame.. first week of December was dope for me, gettin rekt now.. Goodluck homie!"
2722,When you sell puts you must have cash. Robinhood will lock the cash up until you buy back the contract you sold and basically close your position or until it expires worthless.   This is to prevent you from going crazy over margin and stop retards from fucking up and killing themselves like the one college kid did earlier this year.    For selling calls you must hold the shares. Selling covered calls could be seen as more advantageous bc you also collect the dividends + make profits on the stock price going up.   I don’t do that with TSLA tho bc I believe we are in a bubble and eventually this retarded stock will come back to earth.    I would hold shares and sell covered calls on something like Apple tho.   Premiums are obviously lower for Apple tho since it’s more of a serious company than a meme like TSLA  Edit: I gotta go and can’t keep responding. Hope I helped. Goodluck out there! 🙏🏾👑🐌👑
2723,So is WSB in anarchy mode now?

2726,Sell my wife and go all in PLTR.
2727,In the end it only makes the Republicans look bad if they can't pass it. I am confidence Trump will veto the 600 and 300 UI so nobody will get nothing until next year. About the same time as the Georgia run offs.

2739,Harmless retards don't need mods anyways
2740,"I use TDAmeritrade. Their web client is pretty good, maybe looks like a boomer website to RH users, but I can buy options in a few clicks, and that probably doesn't differ much at all from the RH workflow. Enter the stock ticker -&gt; go to options -&gt; open options chain -&gt; select the one you want, enter any order info (or just use the default they gave you when you select bid or ask) -&gt; review order -&gt; send it. Easy.  The best part is RH makes most of their money by selling user order flow. Yes, you don't pay any commissions on options purchases on RH, but you get shitty bid fills because your order flow gets gobbled up by MMs who then immediately jack up their prices on their options to fuck you. I ALWAYS hear about RH users not getting filled, getting a bad fill, etc. I don't have that issue (most of the time) on TDA. I get timely fills if the stock/option is liquid, I often get fills below the limit I entered, I can even enter market orders and get fills below the bid I would have expected.  So yes, I pay commission on every options trade I do, but I feel its probably made me more money than anything since I can get filled at good prices in a timely manner. I also rarely have outages."
2741,I got in Ocugen at .76. Good times so far.

2789,"HRB is the way, people are sleeping on this stock"
2790,"Well isn’t that a huge oversimplification? Trump wants stimmy amended to $2k, Dems agree, meaning McConnell needs to either get Rs to fall in line or face significant risk of losing their majority in a couple weeks. Either Trump capitulates and the original $600 checks get approved, or Trump holds and McConnell capitulates and we get $2000, or (and I think this is more realistic) both sides negotiate a bit more and we get a number between $600-2000.    I sincerely doubt McConnell allows the Republicans to risk losing all their political power for the next 2 years over a much-needed pandemic relief bill. Maybe he does hold strong, and I’m yet again surprised by the lengths poor white Georgian republican voters will go to shoot themselves in the foot, but since a sizable chunk of current Republican voters are Trumpers above all else, it makes zero sense for them to show out on the 5th."
2791,So when the sub inevitably goes private again do we just brigade r/investing again and piss them off with our retardness?
2792,It’s enforced by reddit admins
2793,Same and initially I was on his side but then I looked at mod log he posted and...seems like a bitch fit lol. Mad someone else hasn’t been doing mod work lately so I quit!
2794,If you get in around 10 or 11 seems to be guaranteed money right now.  I don't know how they have performed historically  though.
2795,Take a guess
2796,"I have 2k shares. Have cash for more, but think that’s sufficient. Need to see some movement before I dump in more."
2797,Remember when it was Luckin Coffee and Hertz giving us the ride of a lifetime? Boy have the tables turned
2798,"Yup, just gotta sell before the merger unless you did your research on the main company and think it's going to moon."
2799,C'mon. You didn't want a bunch of people to try it?
2800,It's more of a World War I sort of situation where people expect any action against Iran to be answered by Russia and potentially some others and then everyone gets pulled into conflict and all of the American allies in the region will be at most risk
2801,NIO? I say it all the time
2802,"Never panic buy or sell. If you like it and you think it has potential, buy some.   If you really like the stock, and it goes down, instead of panic selling it, double down and buy the dip. Best to buy small amounts as it goes down because you don't know how far it will go. This will cost average out some of your losses, if you happened to buy at a peak.   I personally don't like buying if the stock is at a peak and currently going up, it makes my brain all fuzzy and I usually lose money right away when it goes down, which is why I like to buy it when it's going down or has bottomed out instead."
2803,Stagnant is a win.

2836,I’m torn because Robinhood is so easy.
2837,"Yes, they are cyclical in nature. Greatest downside it price falling to NAV level which represents a loss for you unless you bought in from the ground floor. They have a span of a couple years to find a target, so if you buy in early you most likely have to wait months to see any gains at all, which in itself presents an opportunity cost in which having your money parked somewhere else could have been earning you gains all along.   That being said, I’ve switched my portfolio to about 80% spacs. There’s a method to the madness - find the next ticker to get hyped/ having an announcement to act as catalyst and buy in before that, sell for modest gains 20,30, 50%... or get lucky and ride some of these 100+ percent ones."

I follow ARK quite a bit and even signed up for their daily newsletter. From everything I've seen they really know what they're doing. I think they have long term potential."
2908,Start a war silly.  Drone strikes and bombings are a phone call away if they choose.  And the Israeli armed forces.  And Saudi Arabia.  And every other US financed country in the middle east.  LMT needs more growth.

2915,"Yeah, seriously. Been tickling $29's ballsac for weeks now and just refuses to grab it by the cock."
2916,"it's multiple factors.  many people will be out all of next week to use up vacation days they haven't used all year, plus many already do take the week between xmas and NYE off. they're profit taking now before the new year because the market has had a massive runup this year.   tax loss harvesting is pressure to sell  people with big gains are de-risking just in case and are selling in the event the democrats win in GA. If dems control the senate biden can pass big tax increases on corporations and capital gains. that means reduced stock prices because of a bigger chunk out of corporate cash flows plus more taxes on gains  potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in funds (no one knows the exact number) are rebalancing, which adds more selling pressure  just turn off your market trackers and computers until next year. and dont do FDs for the rest of '20."

2947,"Mini DD: Puts on any tech company where the bulk of its business involves hosting online content.  The reason Trump is pulling this stunt with the $2,000 is so that Republicans can insert an amendment to repeal section 230 of the omnibus spending bill, which would remove liability protections for media and tech companies. Basically it would mean that Facebook could get sued for anything some random idiot posts using their service. Suddenly Facebook becomes responsible for every moron spreading slanderous conspiracy theories or making death threats in their Facebook group. It would be incredibly bad for tech.  It's supposed to be a poison pill that causes Democrats to vote down the bill, so that Republicans can then point at Democrats and say they shot down the $2,000 payments.  What I suspect will happen is that Pelosi will call their bluff and it goes through anyway with the poison pill.  Puts on tech because whether or not section 230 actually does get repealed, the uncertainty of it all will make investors scared in the short term. FB big red tomorrow."
2948,"Yep, that’ll do it.  You were pricing in what like a 10% move to a 2T company in a week not considering premium?  ATM/ITM long calls get sexier and sexier the longer you look"

2958,Do it on GE
2959,Dam at least I'm poor so I can't lose that much
2960,It’s showing you the live value of your positions right now giving you a picture of what your positions would net you if you were to close them right now. Because PLTR went up in price you would lose money if you closed those positions now. Over time they’ll go down toward zero as you get closer to expiration and theta gets heavier. That’s assuming that PLTR doesn’t moon between now and then.
2961,Y’all looking at AOC but tbh Mitch’s wife isn’t too damn bad. Being the 4th most powerful person in the country does wonders to your sex game

Took a lot of time to reflect on what decision lead to a loss on those days and have a better feel for what I’m looking at now when I see it. I’ve always been very good with money IRL so this is a bit more risk than I’ve taken before, but I am also very patient and seem to recognize trends and what I’m buying through research pretty well. But again I could be wrong and completely fuck shit up. Spreading out risk more instead of YOLO has been working well. I still yolo some plays when I sense a stock is dropped a bit too far."

These guys have become complacent they need someone to kick there ass like ELON.   Also no innovation is being done in cell phone segment as well. They have plenty of money but don't fucking know where to use it.

3291,"May be a good bet. Honestly I was thinking of pulling my GME and NIO to put into PLTR and double up. Then let it ride for now into next year. Then hold that, and could possibly do what you’re talking about. Both options seem pretty good. But the latter more profitable in the long run.    Thanks for the advise!"
3292,We need a chad bull mod for morale

3307,Man there’s so many buttfuck Greeks it’s impossible to keep track of. You probably just bought the top lol.
3308,"Don’t you guys feel like the reason why we’re pumping into SPAC’s so much is because we all believe that our world as it is now just isn’t working... like I’m from SoCal and climate change has been fucking us in the ass with fires and the random ass weather, I know it’s only gonna get worse and maybe this is wall street doing it’s thing to try and save humanity 😅they always say, vote with ur dollars amirite"

3766,r/Libertaliabets there just did it
3767,"Bruh, why don’t you create a new sub, name it I donno zstreetbets, you will get a million subscribers in no time"
3768,"What if McConnell merely says something positive about the 2k stimmy payments  Something like, “we understand the American people need help, we didn’t have the votes necessary before but I think after president trumps leadership on this that may have changed”  At least give me credit for the Mitch impersonation."

3775,Ehh I bought one at 3 I think it might drop some more if trump keeps bashing the stimulus.
3776,"I hit a 12/31 CHWY 10 bagger, and then for some reason thought being so deep in the money that I should just hold through expiry. Lol."
3777,"Dude i made $30k off of WFC just today, it’s such a beauty of a stock, new competent CEO, still hasn't recovered from covid crash and it’s a bank, it’s gonna make money, but I haven’t found any other undervalued stock like WFC and i dont wanna go all in what do  maybe visa?"

3781,Whenever it’s enough for you.  It’s not real money until the gains are realized.
3782,PLTR..... overvalued?   Hold that energy when it’s +100$ this time next year
3783,So no more mods?
3784,So what happened
3785,That won't change anything. People want exactly what is being purchased. They get to fulfill a voyeuristic fantasy completely in their control at a low price point.
3786,A 9 yr old YouTuber made $25 million last year. You’ve made terrible life choices all around
3787,"Hmmm, finger; yeah, I was thinking about a finger 🤔"

3795,Oh ok so that’s how holidays work thanks
3796,Today I literally invested all 60k I have into ARKG shares and I’m letting it ride for a year or two.
3797,Where is the best place to buy a MacBook? Need a new laptop and using the gains to purchase one soon. Also are there normally post holiday deals?
3798,I remember when I was bored on the internet I would just check out porn. Now it’s like 10% porn and the rest of the time googling companies and looking at futures. Not sure what is more unhealthy tbh
3799,"the thing is apple already has that green eco marketing, them not having a charger with new phones? that's green af, changing the adapter size for new phones so ppl will have to dump old ones and buy new ones? that's green af, and there name is an apple like a GREEN apple. wtf is a tesla? some old boomer? def not green, get in while apples cheap my friend."

3804,"Same bruh, spent $20, Not worth it"
3805,You're talking to a guy who's poor as fuck. Nearly 30 and maybe a couple hundred to my name. These things have nothing to do with attracting women in my experience. Being a person who loves yourself and who has an authentic personality is really what matters.
3806,If you’re getting new it’s pretty much the same price everywhere
3807,Shoot me a quick 100 and you take it and don’t ask questions sir 👀
3808,If you’re over like 24 there’s no way.

3814,Tomorrow's going to be so wacky...only true degenerates will be trading
3815,"Easy.   Step 1: Noticing the individual tickers aren’t moving anywhere in your diversified portfolio so you begin to sell them for small profit or loss. Ie, index and etfs.   Step 2: you begin to buy the individual stocks that was in those etfs that was over performing hoping to catch more upside.   Step 3: You turn into option on those stocks because shares are moving to slow.   Step 4: Realize you need more excitement in your life and trading is no longer interesting unless your portfolio goes +/- 10% daily.   Step 5: Welcome home."
3816,"FLUX, a new battery"
3817,Whose buying FSLY at 100?  Seems like a good bet to hit 104 at least for end of Jan or around then.
3818,Did you margin up as well??
3819,I like both quite a bit
3820,All mods need to do is disable new account posting. MM/Hedge fund nerds trying to manipulate and cuck wsb just set post limits and time subbed parameters before being able to post their fake dds.
3821,None. Republicans are the no spend party
3822,Walmart &amp; target
3823,Do it
3824,Most likely gonna end up being a great idea. Don't even look at it for a year. Save up 2k and put it into a different account for YOLO options.
3825,Need cash for new golf clubs. Give me some stocks that will moon before NY. Am europoor so options are kinda hard
3826,Are ICLN calls for February 2021 still a good play or has the ship already sailed?
3827,"lol, you must be as bad at math/statistics as all the girls who want men who are over 6' tall, make over $250k/year, etc. and think they have a shot in hell at getting one. Pretty sure it's maybe 5% of girls on onlyfans who make decent money. Even if they aren't on that site, take a distribution of women, most are going to be 5s. Doubt anyone under a 7 is getting sugar daddies to pay them thousands a month."
3828,"How are they underestimated? Honestly curious because the valuation suggests they’ll compete and win against Microsoft, Google and Facebook who are the most ruthless companies on the planet"
3829,they all want to see her tits.  me too.
3830,Naaaa   Mabey In your country   In the USA to many woman watch Kim Kardashian   And Cardi b and want to twerk for a 8 figure man
3831,Just went to see on r/stocks what they are up to and there’s this kid that thinks DIS will moon because of the Boba Fett show. And I thought I was the one being retarded.
3832,Welcome to hell bitch. I bought the dip for a month straight and ended up just taking a massive tax loss write off and it feels so good. Will never touch Chinese shit again lesson learned.
3833,Can we all appreciate that this subs mods are involved in more scandals than Enron?
3834,I’m gonna get my ten bagger tomorrow so I’m not even worried

3840,Try to train yourself to wait a day before playing with your gains. Unless it's more PLTR calls
3841,#I BOUGHT YOUR PENNYSTOCK ON FREERIDING FUNDS IN MARGIN ACCOUNT BEFORE CLOSE NOW ITS DOWN 10% AH 🤡👺😈
3842,When your long dated calls go tits up so you buy short dated revenge puts and recover all your losses 🤑
3843,Same story - canceled all my gains on GME with a random TSLA call 🤑
3844,May have another leg down but momentum is building...
3845,"I have a question for you fucktards With common shares, you are able to set a trailing stop loss so you can hope for further gains but automatically sell if the momentum fades. Are you able to do the same with options on robinhood? If so I haven’t been able to figure out how. Any help regarding trailing stops on RH options would be greatly appreciated. If it doesn’t exist on RH, is there any other trading platform that does have them?"
3846,You should make a sub reddit for us degenerate loners :)
3847,I’m sorry to hear that.  Now that you sold it is going to moon.  Sorry bitch.
3848,All these fast money questions are so fucking weak. Everyone is asking about stocks that been  played out. They're late by like 3 months
3849,So when do the citizens start killing the politicians?
3850,PLTR &amp; AMZN look like they are about to explode. I'm all in. 🧨🚀
3851,lol again at these bears thinking they are going to get a win. Retards think there’s gunna be a dump when they don’t realize all the people who dumped did it after Black Friday and are currently on vacation not giving even a single fuck about their puts that are going to finally make them extinct tommorow
3852,Bro it’s 3 days fucking giving me a heart attack

3858,Private sub again. Mass bans agains. V 3.0 coming 2021. See you on the other side warrior.
3859,I'm up $50k since Nov 20. But I'm still down $43k for the year. It would a christmas miracle if I could get one more big win on the books before EOY so I didn't have this stupid loss carrying over for the next 13 years... Sigh.
3860,I love Star Wars I cum on my figurines daily. But the stock won’t moon because of it. D+ barely makes money
3861,Can't name it zstreetbets anymore because I took it
3862,Ya keep coping. 50x sales is overvalued no matter what type of company but especially for a company with a tiny TAM that works only with government agencies. Your Stockholm syndrome and autism have combined into full retardation.
3863,Why would you go anywhere but apple. They price control like a mf so you’re not saving anything going somewhere else
3864,Bruh this is a sinking ship.... for now. Ride the wave
3865,"no particular reason other than profit taking in the whole sector, the rise in the last months has been amazing so nothing wrong with exiting."

3868,All the people hoping for a GME short squeeze have had their positions for months now right (and should be net up)? Or are they always doing weeklies?
3869,Happy Festivus!  A Festivus for the Restofus
3870,It’s literally a dead industry. 5 years from now they’re going to be bankrupt I bet. Blockbuster af
3871,You guys are trading with a bunch of algos.  Makers are doing coke in the Hampton’s.

3888,No wonder the sub has turned into such spammy shit recently. Thanks for trying though
3889,FB and Tesla vs Apple. The nerd war has just begun
3890,yesss.  I've been wanting to for a while but the trasnfer to my broker is stuck and it's painful seeing it grow whilst I sort it.
3891,That’s why he nose so much
3892,no one cares for the boomer ass fundamentals right now. It's all about the short squeezeeee. Clapping some 🌈 🐻 ass cheekies. But yeah thanks for helping then!
3893,The market is so fucked lol
3894,"AAPL for the love of god, Christmas, and tendies can you stop being a sloth or a bear and shoot to the moon!"

3896,Yeah I just decided fuck it I trust ARK they are crushing it
3897,All I want for Christmas is SPY 370 tomorrow. Is that really too much to ask? It’s just a damn percentage. Just give me 1%. Hell I’ll even take .5%.

3903,Bears and Bulls are fuk
3904,Y’all think my 290 FB 1/15/21 calls r fuk? I was gonna sell when the day they were up 30% but I had PDT  they are down 50% 🤡
3905,Now that you put it like that.... 250c 03/21
3906,They're one and the same
3907,For real though we are going down bigly. I did find it odd that SQQQ was green while spy was big green. It all makes sense now.
3908,It’s almost impossible for it to moon
3909,"Always more shares now &amp; forever! Infinity shares! CC sounds like a good way to miss all the top gains. If it spikes you don't get all the benefits. But hey we're both makin money today so highfive ✋ Also duh dude. In the Q3 call they said they only got it in case covid drags on forever, they explicitly said they don't need it atm."
3910,"Yeah you can do it on rObInHoOd. The little gear on the top right corner when you go to sell your contracts, very useful for not diamond handing gains into the ground."
3911,Oh I see
3912,not all mods are the same.  there's janitors and coders.  wsb lost its coder.
3913,Remember ICLN has holdings outside of the US. Might make more sense to buy calls on some of the top US green stocks like Plug and Enphase
3914,GME market cap is only 1360million  so perhaps WSB has 10% of GME shares XD
3915,Prob about this big.... [https://imgur.com/a/D8gqnxm](https://imgur.com/a/D8gqnxm) or about $90
3916,patience my friend we will see 140 within 15 days

3923,Hes just pumping
3924,Watch as the markets begin the next leg down once WSB closes its doors 🥲
3925,So can I say fuck now?
3926,Is this a sign?  Return of the 🌈🐻 Could it be??
3927,It’s a meme
3928,Maybe because they are profitable. WSB only pushes pre revenue companies and such.
3929,"I think so but I don't recommend it, because options prices fluctuate so severely and rapidly (especially if high volume/high volatility) that people will put in high amounts of low bids and artificially widen the spread and your stops will be hit pretty quickly"

3932,I’m all shares baby. I’m good. Got 150 shares. Gonna sell 50 once we hit $100/share. Then hold until the first stock split.
3933,Anyone in AMD right now?     I feel like it is going to break to the downside. I only picked up my calls yesterday at the dip so only down a little right now but I am going to cut and run if we get a bounce tomorrow...
3934,RIP WSB  it was nice knowing yall
3935,Not his money anyway. Remember his base are blue collars. Always want more money but not work more
3936,"Wake up tomorrow, check in to find WSB banned. Check the market, to find it doesnt move whatsoever, nothing moves, totally flat.   It was then that we realized, It was us, it was only us."
3937,I just need 133-135 and I’ll be happy. Should have sold at market open on Monday but thought shit this EV got people hyped. Tim Apple just tweet a stock image of a car with an apple on it and take me home !!
3938,This is like the 5th straight day where I have put in 200 bucks in a play and it went up 600% but my 5k go down 20%

Developing a new chassis and powertrain all together rarely ever happens and if it does its around once every ten years even for the big dogs. Recently Chinese money has sped up some product life cycles but still. An example would be Porsche 997 gt3 4.0. Its a gt3 rs with a bored out engine and some better suspension mods and slightly lighter in essence - think different trim package rather than a totally different car ... they spent nearly half a million dollars changing the fender turn signal indicators to be slightly wider in order to meet the European and American regulation for turn signals. Just the turn signals for a car they had already been building for 5 years and likely took an engineer/drafstman/cad tech an hour to modify the existing part."

4057,I told you that sticking your Dick in hot coffee was a bad idea bro...
4058,"Let’s say you find a small time lemonade business that returned $1000 last year.  You plan to buy the entire business. How much would you have to pay ?  Surely, you would like to pay less than $1000. But it’s likely that the entire set up - the equipment and raw material - cost significantly more than $1000.  Let’s say, again, that the cost to purchase the business is $10,000. In terms of the market, this amount would denote the market capitalisation of the business - the amount needed to buy the entire business, or the market value of the company’s outstanding shares.  So you bought a business for $10,000 that generated a revenue of $1000 in its first year.  Let’s assume that you’re a smart businessman, and that the business starts growing at a rapid pace in line with the numbers below:  Second year revenue: $4,000  Third year revenue: $8,000  Fourth year revenue: $12,000  Viola! The business that you bought at $10,000 is generating revenues of $12,000.  The revenue exceeds the market cap!  Hence, it is possible for a business to generate revenues which exceeds its market cap, a case in which the  is lower than 1; in our case right now, it stands at ($10,000/$12,000) = 0.83  As the story moves forward, Sir Lawrence Wildman from Wall Street (1987) gets wind of your business that cost $10,000 but reported a revenue of $12,000.  Also, he believes he can boost the revenue much further, probably to $1,000,000 in the next five years as he intends to create a brand around the business - the ‘Coca-Cola of lemonades’, so to speak.  So, he comes up to you, and offers you $200,000 for the entire business. And you sell your business, one that you bought for $10,000.  Not a bad return, Id’ say.  By the way…  …the market cap exceeds the revenue now!  Hence, in anticipation of future earnings, the market cap has a tendency to exceed its revenue; people pay not for what has happened, but for what they believe will happen.  Accordingly, the Price-Sales ratio usually exceeds 1 for most publicly listed companies.  Having stated the above, it is important to call out that a low Price-Sales ratio doesn’t necessarily mean that a company is a good buy. What if the revenue of the lemonade stand was $1000, but made a profit of $1 only, as $999 went into fuel costs since the OPEC went crazy?  Spending $10,000 for a profit of $1 ? The , a metric oft quoted, is 10,000 !!! Who in their right minds would buy this business?  However, and let’s get down to cold facts now:  “Between 1979 and 2008, the cap-to-rev-ratio averaged 1.12. The ratio is 1.05 when calculating index data back to 1968.  Data supports the assertion that market forces are constantly seeking a natural equilibrium between total market capitalization and total revenue. Investors that can identify the points where a market has strayed too far below 1 can buy the market before total market capitalization catches up to total revenue, and vice versa.  Past performance validates this assumption. When the cap-to-rev ratio was less than 1.00 the S&amp;P 500 returned nearly 10% more than in periods when the cap-to-rev ratio was greater than 1.  Before the market crash, the cap-to-rev ratio was 1.39 and indicated an overvalued stock market.”  Source:   So, if you do find companies whose revenue exceeds their market cap, it’s likely that you have found a really good buy. But then, there’s a difference between likelihood and surety.  To sum up, it’s not that the revenue is always less than the market cap, but that the market cap is usually higher than the revenue.  Hope this helps."

I might offer a personal story:  Tax planning time, I realize that with income down this year, it's a fine time to crack that dowdy old Vanguard SP500 fund for more $$$ to put in the ark and likely pay $0-minimal long term capital gains in the process.   Anyway, I'm looking at ol' mango and congress over here with their shenanigans and not knowing what the fuck they are doing as usual, and in the meanwhile, the S&amp;P looks like it's holding nicely at over 3700, \~ + 0.5% so I get to thinking well, today is as fine a day to make that move as any. Things might get figured out and we might have more like SPY 380 by the end of the year, but then again, they might not and missing out on the tax window is going to be more painful than missing the last bit of theoretical gains, so I pull the trigger.  Anyway, if I was smart enough to figure that out, I'm sure lots of other people and institutions did too and the combined effect of that many people coming to the same conclusion probably contributed bigly to the big drop."

I'd also like to see an optional passenger seat so I can buy one lol I am also unsure about the subscription model, I need to see pricing for that. Its a good set it and forget it idea for businesses that will save them money in throng run in time if nothing else only having one contact to work with instead of three (car purchase and finance, maintenance, and insurance), but if I am honest I can't see a ton of businesses chosing such a frilly package.

There is a reason why you got $50/share for a 2/19 put at that strike.   I mean, you didn't sell 10 of them, so we're only talking about tens of thousands of dollars here, but options are always priced appropriately for risk.

4328,"I think yes, they’ll have infrastructure hurdles down the line with their subscription model as if you’re on the other side of America and need a service you don’t wanna have to travel a long way to get it repaired. But then again this is way down the line from where they’re at now.   With regards to the production model, I’m a little concerned that there’s always a little push and shove with how big the actual thing will be for customers.   One thing I like at the moment about GOEV is the customisable potential with it, looking forward to see if they can make a sexy car model down the line. However part of me doesn’t want one from them. They’re practical, not “sexy”  So far I can see them doing very well with the B2B model and also the autonomy side they have developing is exciting. Not to mention the partnership announcements late jan."

4609,"Think about it.. buying a house is like using margin. Instead of putting $50k in an index fund, put it on a house, let the appreciation of the house at $500k do the work for you.   I have two homes in Austin. $1.2mil appreciating 7% a year and I only had to put down $100k between the both and a renter pays for one of them. So I get one house for free in 30 years, can write down taxes from property taxes, and just make sure the rent covers all the bills on it. It’ll triple in price while I do nothing but make sure I don’t rent to degenerates. Meanwhile all the extra cash I didn’t use on the down payment goes to FD’s.  This is how you get rich: debt."

I can't believe this but all of the sudden the possibility that we won't get a stimulus bill went up. I can't believe these mfers.  On the day before Christmas Eve.  Families will be worried about being kicked out of their homes. People will lose uninsurance benefits due to jobs that they lost of no fault of their own due to COVID.   For those of you who may not know, if they don't get this done SOON people WILL get removed from their homes via evictions. The eviction moratorium ends on Dec 31st. Even IF we wait until Jan 6th for the Dems to sweep the Senate (which who the fuck knows if they will) and jam in the bill with a majority, people will have already started getting removed from their homes.  The most Dems would be able to do is mega-pump the economy with huge stimmys that Biden/Pelosi/Schumer said they'd do if they got control.  Fuck this shit."

4780,"They WERE trying to wait for GA runoffs. That's what the original stimulus bill was about - compromising and postponing the bickering until after the runoff and new inauguration.  Mango just decided to take a huge dump on them (the GOP).  GOP has been hamstrung with his recent announcements (vetoes, $2k checks, etc) because more than half their base doesn't care about the context of ANY of this. They'll just blame ""DC"" or ""Washington"" (instead of realizing the people they're putting in are the exact ones shafting them) and then go vote for anyone who dared to oppose King Mango.  That's why you have people like Graham and McCarthy publicly coming out saying they wouldn't override Trump's veto, while at the same time saying they oppose $2k checks. Which doesn't make sense, but why would you have to if your constituents don't understand anyway."

4793,Both the things I said are true. You look them up. It isnt a debate forum. The stats are fake and you are an idiot for thinking corporations wouldn't fudge numbers to get more money.

So he's taking a dump on the GOP. But to what end? Because they aren't supporting his coup? I know he's a clinically dumb person and so we shouldn't be expecting tactical brilliance here, but I really do wonder what he's hoping to get from this, because it sure as shit doesn't have anything to do with our well being"

5103,"Except while Graham and McCarthy have indicated that they would not override Trump's veto on the MILITARY bill, they also indicated that they would NOT support a $2k stimulus check.  Essentially, Trump is trying to tie his efforts to repeal Section 230 which was tied into the military spending bill  What seems to be happening right now seems to be that they are trying to hold a gun to the Dems heads and saying ""look, repeal section 230 on the military spending bill and you MIGHT get $2k stimulus checks on the stimulus bill"".  Which, first of all, that's bad faith negotiations. They'd spent 3 FUCKING WEEKS discussing this shit and they came to a compromise. Then they pull this bullshit? ALSO, that's not a discussion that can be had over the next couple of days.  And I'm calling you out for being full of shit because you said this:  &gt;Or they can convince few Republican Senator and pass a big stimulus bill with $2000 stimulus check right now. **But they are waiting for Biden to take over so that Trump doesn’t get the credit.** Fuck this shit.  By they, you mean Dems. FOH with this shit trying to throw blame on both sides. IF we end up having a delayed stimulus bill due to this fucking political grandstanding bullshit, we'll have a bunch of people thrown out of their homes and penniless (due to unemployment running out).

Uvxy   Might sell some of what I have too if it goes up a lot and based on a couple other reasons. I’ll be holding a solid amount for the next few weeks at bare minimum regardless but making money in between is always fun    So to answer ur question       Tomorrow I am either buying or selling      Yay

5378,"modding sounds like a hard job, they start by intervening and taking a lot of correcting actions, at least what they believe to be correcting, then little by little they become more sophisticated and wise so they see the wrong in some actions they took and believed to be correct, that’s when they start observing more and intervening less, they start seeing farther ahead and realize that all the small things they were focused on don’t matter long term and they should conserve their energy for observing and studying the patterns, at this point they’ve already started to lose touch with the small actions and small actions committers they once used to closely moderate, then comes a phase of believing that intervening at all doesn’t matter because what’s going to happen is going to eventually happen no matter the small details, then later they start seeing a pattern where certain small events have the ability of significantly affecting the timeline, negatively or positively, and they start to intervene to prevent those events they perceived and deemed as negative, then they become more wise and sophisticated that they realize they have perceived some good as bad and some bad as good, so they start observing and studying more, and intervening less, then they become more out-of-touch, so on and so forth, then eventually we all start wondering why we wasted so much time and energy participating in this clown show, then eventually we all die and either expire worthless or come back and repeat the cycle like sisyphus or both    such is life i guess, i don’t like it, i don’t like these cycles, we will change it hopefully"

5491,"**Preamble: Reinfections are common given the opportunity. Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.**  You can estimate antibody half life from how often people are getting reinfected. The antibodies created by the vaccine decay at the same rate.   &gt;Antibody Half Life: The period in which the radioactivity or number of atoms of a radioactive substance decreases by half; similarly applied to any substance, such as a drug in serum, whose quantity decreases exponentially with time.  All other immune responses induced by the vaccine after the initial antibody boost are the same as after a natural infection.  &gt;Next, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html  **1)** If bi-annual vaccine doses are needed, its a problem.

5518,"I'll be honest, it's not my favorite play of the year. They do ibuying, essentially home flipping. They're only in a handful of markets but are expanding.  It was a Chamath SPAC, formerly IPOB.  I was up $2k+ on Monday but things came crashing down the past few sessions... I'd say put this on your Watchlist for now.

5557,I'm in 45c. Some retard will get rich off 60c. No one can tell you what will print. Try buying 1 contract and see how it goes. Don't plow 5k into 19 contracts that you barely understand. It's not about being a noob. It's about expecting others to do all the thinking for you. Low risk is buying stock. Most options expire worthless.

5630,"This is one of the biggest blockers imho that keeps US at the top and China below them on the international stage.  Companies for the most part have so much power all around the world - our capitalistic societies ensure that those who hold the most capital holds the most power.  As long as China/JinPing continues to use their powers to dickslap their oppositions in plain view (which is probably really great for their consolidation of power), internationally no one is going to fully commit to them. How could you trust a system where if you piss off the wrong person, you're gone? That goes doubly so for people who have all the money - they're not used to not having any power.  As much as Legoman is a total asshole (he used to say that people should be grateful to work like 80 hours a week in his company or some crazy shit),  this is probably what he was hoping would stop China from fucking him over. Sadly for him and many BABA holders, they found out China does not give a fuck."

5738,lmaoooo he purged all of the replies to this. ridiculous. sorry this happened to you u/zjz - i know how it is to be on a mod team where the top mods do nothing but are obsessed with retaining “power” (whatever the fuck power is to moderating for free on reddit). it is disheartening. happy cake day and wish you the best
5739,I’ve got big hopes for BTWN. You in it?
5740,gtfoh.  Ma offered to nationalize portions of Ant Group “aS lOnG aS tHe cOuNtRy nEeDs iT”.  Take your state controlled methods of production bullshit somewhere else.  Nationalizing shit doesn’t work because the fucking retards in government have zero clue about efficiently using capital and resources.    BABA is dead in the water.  I’m surprised Ma hasn’t been disappeared yet.
5741,You don't have to be one or another

5756,Since it was announced the GDP/US$ went from 1.34 to 1.35  Congrats
5757,Why are u on your period
5758,Yeah but that is what options are about. It’s not about if a company is good or bad. In fact more volatile the better. Also it’s clear PR companies and others with more nefarious plans spam their tickers. That bro with the little rocket emojis prob doesn’t have shit and they are just trying to incite interest in their ticker.
5759,I'm tired and I need a coffee

5761,"The line between what feels good and what is true has become increasingly blurred. At some point, it will be more clear that Apple doesn’t have our best interests in mind. An easier example at the moment is Facebook. Social media is clearly addictive (and made to be that way) and has negative consequences for us. They aren’t supposed to care though, they are supposed to make money."

5870,Shorts are fucked
5871,You’re not L2FBAH
5872,"Yeah, the buying and selling is simple. I have a stop loss set at 12595 so i'm risking somewhat under &lt;10k. The biggest lesson I learned trading futures was always have stop losses. It's a lot easier to lose a large amount than make it due to the fact that you can move into negative cash and the positions won't sell themselves until 24-48 hours after margin call."
5873,Your futures are delayed just so you know

First the Palantir boys came for his boomer investing strats, then they came for his porn, now his favorite sub was about to kick it.  Nothing made sense anymore.

5976,I think most people use Plug as a guide for Fcell. If Plug can get to $36 so can Fcel. FCELL is my largest holding. I see it continuing it's pace for some time to come still.
5977,Yeah. I jumped on the 12/18 35c train. All in. Barely made it out alive.
5978,"Just what everyone’s been saying and Melvin opened a huge put position rather than shorting. Also iborrow is only having problems with GME, no other ticker"
5979,its ok. GME  pumps in first 3 hours then fades. so tmrw is just GME pump day.
5980,It makes my weiner twitch
5981,Actually a great time to buy BABA if you can handle the volatility. They ain't gonna dismantle their largest company with billions of foreign investment. This kinda shit happens every 3 months with FB
5982,Remember last nights future action? +.2 -&gt; -.6 -&gt; +.4. All of us thinking today was gonna be red. What an exciting night.
5983,I can't find that ticker Euphoria...
5984,"Its one day at a time bro, look to r/NoFap for advice"
5985,"Ya Allah, did you mean to visit r/MuslimNoFap? In challah you will be victorious.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
5986,"BABA hitting 230 in HK.      When it hits its floor, it will be a great time to load up on 2023 LEAPs. $$$$ 400 by end of 2021."
5987,Understandable. Have a nice day
5988,"Actually, contrary to popular belief, it’s only gay if it’s gay."
5989,So glad I sold my 300c Jans a week ago.
5990,So square buying tidal and apple making cars? Definitely not in a bubble.
5991,I think Jack Ma was just lucky and in the right place to become rich rofl...
5992,"Where it rejected today is kinda bad but as long as it can stay above like 224, should be fine. CRM will eventually get back above $260, just a matter of time. How long it takes and how low it goes until then, I don't know."
5993,They need a dip to buy before gapping up
5994,"Not sure what’s funnier, the fact that r/lululemon has a pinned rant thread or the fact that every chick flexing pics there could wear men’s sizing lol"
5995,Futures GAPPING up right now
5996,It will
5997,Just wanna say thank you to  all the WSB OGs and experts who saved my dumb ass. I was about to YOLO 125K on 10 QS contracts yesterday. Got so many public and private messages not to do it. You were all correct. WS would have blown  right past my strike within 3 hrs of markets opening today. How do you guys predict this shit? Thank you.
5998,ya i noticed that today. what source can show that it was actually Melvin and not just someone that opened that position.
5999,The retards on this subreddit man...it’s a beautiful thing.
6000,It’s only gay if you look him in the eyes
6001,"u/zjz is a real fucking mod. I once wrote some throwaway comment about how the mods don’t care about the dumbest shitposts (this was the dark days of dozens of spongebob memes) and he took time to write me a novel explaining the calculus behind their mod choices. Serious, the dude cared.  I hope the biproduct isn’t that we get banned for shilling of some crap that doesn’t get effectively shut down"
6002,Do I average down on my baba leaps ... this is so bad fuck my shitty life
6003,Prediction for rest of year: decent sell-off sometime between now and the rest of the year or maybe even early Jan so we can all reload on calls and then moon the fuck outta the rest of the year. Praying for a dip to renter
6004,hopefully a technical double bottom and now leg higher haha
6005,Right at the time when the stimulus bill is DOA and a new tax everything administration starts in a few weeks. The timing is awesome.
6006,"Nah, though curious why SQ dropped too? I have both SQ and DQ. DQ is doing really well lately and news just came out today of [two deals with big solar manufacturers](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/daqo-new-energy-announces-long-term-high-purity-polysilicon-supply-agreements-with-two-customers-301198010.html).

6007,So.. this whole sub was on the baba BTFD train? lol
6008,even BABA LEAPS are getting GUH'd tmrw.
6009,Aaaaaaaand it's gone.
6010,Nothing new that I know of. I'm loving how they put all of their deals on blast though
6011,I hate seeing the old me in so many of those posts.
6012,What do you do when the renter refuses to pay and the govt extends the eviction moratorium for another couple years? Now you big time fucked. Or on their way out they leave all the water running and bust up all the toilets just to get back at the man.
6013,"Yeah I'm surprised the insurance companies still insure them, havent they read the literature! How can companies based on risk assessment be so blind to the dangers!"
6014,To be completely honest I’m really happy the mods are gone. Fuck those guys 100%
6015,probably a better way of spending tbh
6016,"Fuck, if BABA dips low enough I may sell all my shit and literally go balls deep"
6017,I [now understand](https://i.redd.it/4e3nty8mkrq51.jpg) why LULU is so overvalued
6018,Bought near OTM calls for Jan. those are now worthless.
6019,It’s a sticky situation
6020,"Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
6021,BABA is a very good company. Can't always predict the CCP. Fucking Jack Ma needs to keep his mouth shut
6022,just paid off my student loans and now I gotta margin loan lmfao
6023,Damn it
6024,Let’s hope it happens lol
6025,Thoughts on ALPP since mods are hiding
6026,The amount of banned tickers is too damn high. Cant even use general acronyms anymore cause it's a banned ticker lmao.  How long until LMAO becomes a banned ticker?
6027,Apologies!! Thought you typo’d for SQ :)
6028,all cause this cuckold Jack ma wouldnt bend the knee. now his shareholders getting bent over.
6029,These aren't really important futures... nothing useful happens for hours.
6030,so glad I chose not to fuck with Chinese stocks ngl
6031,"There’s no direct source but Melvin closed there other put position, likely opened this one today. It was a spread actually I think"
6032,LOL the most clear sight? the fucking gap up open. Called a blow off top
6033,Hong Kong opened 30 min ago and it’s down -6%
6034,RIP BABA.. it was nice while we’re at it
6035,It’s beautiful but there are issues with drainage in south florida. Check out vizcaya and key biscayne. Coconut grove used to be fun but was a ghost town when I went. I hear the casino is fun but never went. Check out the keys. Miami is the best! Have fun bro.
6036,If this shit could open at 370 tomorrow it will be a Xmas miracle. A really gay one at that.
6037,Praying to Santa for a 2% TSLA gap up
6038,When they came for BABA I had no cash so I said nothing.  When they came for CVS there was no one left to speak for me.
6039,Does anyone have a limit sell set up for GME in case of infinity squeeze?
6040,Baba weeklies are worthless
6041,Quite the opposite. I’m bullish AF for 2021 just would love a broad market dip to buy
6042,"If Apple opens super green tomorrow, I will buy a green Apple and cut a 1/4in hole in it and fuck it with my peen."

6046,Same I’m a 🥸 🐻
6047,"Thanks for your involvement here and the boys. I don't post on this sub much anymore, but it's sad to see the bullshit continue.  When I was a mod for a few months, I was cleaning shit off the front page like I was a fucking internet janitor. Then that cocksucker fartek and stormwontpass castrated my admin rights without telling me, so I quit.  Best of luck in retirement. Hope the tendies are in your favor."

6053,"Dang, baba gang can’t catch a break. Sorry guys that sucks"
6054,No idea. I don’t play Tesla or other EVs.   But I think they should be fine.
6055,Jack Ma is Chinese Trevor Milton?
6056,Is that what all the flair is?  Lmao I have been trying to figure that out for awhile.  2 guesses:  a) i was banned recently like 2-3 weeks ago or b) i got an automod message warning me that reddit does bans and I immediately edited my post to “fd” but still ended up getting banned by reddit.
6057,"I have SQ (and PYPL) too, so am curious what this tidal rumour thing is?"
6058,Please don’t. Wsb kills everything
6059,Praying that WBA finally goes over 41.50$ so my calls are finally worth something...

6062,"no, he has a product and basically a monopoly."
6063,"Some gold from r/dividends:    But dividend is like marriage. You're committed. And because you're committed you don't get scared. You keep buying and buying and before you know it, your dividend is paying you 1,5, 10,20,30k a month. Regular stocks is like a hot girlfriend. Sure it's hot and you invest in her. But you aren't committed. Much easier to break up and leave which in turn doesnt provide you wealth. Just some fast money pleasure where you THINK you're getting rich. But in fact, it fades as you keep timing the market and make mistakes.   Imagine settling for anything in life."
6064,I don't know if my math is off but BABA is at 232 HK... which is around $241 USD right?   HK price * 8 * 0.13
6065,Totalitarian states don't fuck around when people challenge their power. It's gonna drill for a while before recovering.

6077,"it'll be trading over 500, just donno when. lol"
6078,Seems like it lmao. Alot of people were trying to do it under the radar. Their pain is visible now
6079,Paper handing BABA for a small loss a while back is probs the best decision I’ve made
6080,dividend is probably the worst way for a company to spend money lmao
6081,"I was lucky as fuck. Just shocked so many accurately predicted it would drop back below 110 today. I know stonks go up and down, but why did so many know it would crash today?Do you predict this shit from Technical Analysis?"

6083,My answer when asked by family members how it is going at work.   [occupation](https://tenor.com/bawkC.gif)
6084,So what’s the risk with this funding bill not getting passed? Are we fuk or just another excuse to dump EOD. Or was the dump just offloading before the long weekend
6085,this play didnt work well during election weeks thats for sure
6086,A moment of silence for our Baba Boiis!!😰😰🙏🏼
6087,No you don’t understand. We only inverse them when they shit on our memes. When the pump is we citron gang.

6092,"that dude has the smallest dick of anyone ive ever seen. i guarantee he is going to respond with ""ban"" or some stupid shit that he repeats non stop like a robot. probably has a team call he has to go work on right now anyways for his overlord zucc and his 200 sq ft studio apartment in his commie land  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

6096,Can’t wait to BTFD on BABA in the coming days. Great opportunity.
6097,Can anyone TLDR that mod drama so Cramer can talk about it on Mad Money tomorrow?
6098,Fomo'd into 1/15 130s at the literal top. Would be nice to break even

6105,The sequence of emojis was like a movie
6106,"Dividends are retarded. The stock instantly drops in value by the dividend price, so they accomplish basically nothing."

6110,Why? They don't do anything. They turn trash into trash.
6111,Imagine some Goldman Sachs executive comes on this sub to see what the general sentiment is about tomorrow’s open and the first thing he reads is a comment about a guy carving a hole in an apple and sticking his dick in it. Lmao
6112,Microsoft proved you can get by with a fine and keep your shit mostly the same.  China has levels of control over their companies that the USA federal government pretends it doesn’t have and then some.
6113,"God, motley fool is such shit. They really jerk themselves off. Was just looking into mgni, and they wrote “investing legends and cofounders.. blah blah blah”. If you gotta say you’re an investing legend, you’re probably not one"
6114,china is gonna be so mad that baba rockets tomorrow because of everyone using rh to buy anything that has a dip
6115,you are fucked dude
6116,Fucking retarded. Sells off hard end of day just for these fucks in futures to buy it up back to the same spot.
6117,Lol putting faith in Xi to say BABA isn't a monopoly 🤣🤣
6118,“Baba down in HK after Chinese authorities launch antitrust probe”  This is called making an example. Xi doesn’t fuck around playing the game of thrones.
6119,"Good luck. I learned the hard way not to do it with VXX. Since then, I've made some money just with VXX shares."
6120,"I mean, he's clearly not a fucking savant by any means, sure.  But who gets to that level of wealth without luck, at the end of the day? Even the smartest fucking people in the world need luck to at to THAT level of wealth."

6125,"My question is, how do so many know the exact week, the crash would happen. I was planning a 12/24 expiry. I thought it was a bullet proof plan. Can’t believe it dropped so much in 1 day and most people who sent me messages knew. Is this a technical analysis skill?"
6126,"RAD had a solid run up to their earnings, but pharmacy gang has been taking a beating the last few weeks. I took the cue from CVS today to make another big move and piled into a lot of 70c for 1/15, 1/22, 1/29, and 2/19."
6127,"It shows you the management of the company has no fucking clue what to do to grow the company, too."
6128,That’s because it’s  an hbo show about millennials
6129,Can confirm.  WSB became a worse place the day fartek (the infamous cousin of 🅱️artek) demoted Shmokes 🚬 back to normie status.
6130,Yeah. I’ll listen to you who literally didn’t know why it fell five minutes ago
6131,"Because BABA looks like it's at ""discount"". Even ARK bought back a bunch of the shares it sold off last month 2 days ago."
6132,"Sir, this is a Wendy- wait 30k a month?"
6133,Anyone have a S P A C calendar for January?
6134,"I'm assuming they'd be planning to revamp it, but people aren't keen?"
6135,And that is the reason china will never overtake the usa. Jack ma is a gonner.
6136,You're assuming the degenerate goldman twat reading this isn't doing something worse
6137,I’m sure I’ll get to 30k dividends/month «before I know it » thanks to my monthly investments of 1/5th of a Wendys cashier minimum wage.
6138,"True, but what are the chances of getting to the point where you can own that many shares without some serious gains along the way before you’re retirement age?"
6139,BIDU looks discounted to me. 20 PE and ARK investments as well  but what do i know
6140,So you’re saying the new/awakened mods are Chinamen in disguise?  I’d believe it.
6141,watching GME from the sidelines all year GME sort of inversed that kind of news. Remember the GME safe haven jokes?  Who knows. I aint selling cause I got those infinity calls aka shares
6142,When is a good time to yolo into airline stocks?
6143,Upvote if horny  Downvote if you bought BABA calls for some fucking reason because you’re retarded and even though everyone is saying “AVOID CHINESE STOCKS” you assume you are smarter than them so you got a leap that you planned on selling in a month or two but itl likely be down 50% tomorrow and now you need to diamond hand that shit OH and you’ll probably get margin called
6144,"Wait, is there really a butt flap? Fuck yeah, now I’m even more excited."
6145,"Dawg I got 30k in May 2021 options. I’m balls deep, it’s 90% of my portfolio. Just didn’t go up with the market. It is about 100% less share price than every other company in its sector and they have zero debt just profits with insane catalysts coming up. Blows my mind, heavily overlooked. Frustrating af somedays"
6146,"Well, that would make me smarter which I'm not. Pretty dumb of you to not realize that."
6147,So BABA leaps at open or just burn that money?
6148,They’re aren’t as dominant as Baba and Tencent are and their CEOs probably know when to shut up and not lecture the dear leader.   Also China needs/wants to be at the top of the green transition so they will push them as much as possible.  With Baba and especially Ant it’s more about them scamming their own population for expensive scam loans while crying for less regulation that made Xi really salty.
6149,Yep. Im one of em cucks now lol
6150,G H I V
6151,it’s 2021 and people are still using wsb for plays instead of shitposts  lmAo
6152,"Shit, CCP have control over some international US firms that the US govt doesn't even dream of."
6153,Everyone’s saying MMs are gonna pin PLTR at $29 but are they really gonna be working on Christmas Eve
6154,"It was 44m over 3 years, which as a government contractor I can tell you is a smol peen government contract for a 50b market cap company.  I'm not telling people not to buy PLTR or ride this bubble, I'm just saying that $15m / year is nothing."
6155,looking at more $sgmo $beam and $ilmn calls
6156,Hopefully a target announcement for PSTH!
6157,"First off, I’m new here, so thanks for immediately ruining this autistic experience for me. Second, I looked at your history of posts here...they’re all low-effort trash. Why do you suck? UGH"
6158,Are you the same guy that emailed the complaint about trades not working on a Sunday?
6159,"https://www.miamicondoinvestments.com/mint-condos  This is the building im eyeing atm. google the gym and spa , its a lifestyle not just ""i got 1000000 sq feet in the middle of nowhere"". Plus when covid is over that area is fucking poppin with ass and nightlife everywhere."
6160,Ya that’s true though I think the real money is far enough out assuming it doesn’t just snap that you could just check in daily. But I feel you I should have done that with PLTR and made my money when i was up for weeklies.
6161,Just buy ABML while it's low
6162,Yang gang possibly coming to a city near you. Wouldn't be shocked if the next mayor of nyc tries to create some kind of quasi ubi system.
6163,Imagine being a Chinese investor and not comfortable being able to just buy the dip bc you don’t have a J Pow and your leader is an asshoe who doesn’t care about the stonk market like Mango does.
6164,cramer pretty much outright said wsb gets manipulated and yet u fucks still listen to DD here lmao
6165,I just got lucky with buying a lot of TSLA and PLTR from reading this subreddit.
6166,"I can’t see too many people rushing back to dirty, stinky ass gyms anytime soon - even when COVID is less of an issue (it won’t be gone for many years, if ever).

6167,"I haven't smoked in over 6 years.  I really want a good 'ol Turkish Jade cig right now, though.  Fuck man, that was my jam.  Pack-a-day, or more for a few years.  mmmm......."
6168,"&gt;just let the shitty businesses die  How it should be.  If you're a business surviving on debt with no cash stockpile, and you can't survive a temporary downturn in business, then you're a weak business.  By bailing these companies out every time there is an economic downturn, we're basically telling companies to be financially irresponsible."
6169,have u met chinese people? they’re probably more wsb than wsb is
6170,"With these kind of things and if you zoom out of the chart to monthly view, you may consider not being retarded and buying first thing. You may see a bounce and you dip buying going green, but just wait, because BABA is the stock that will continue you to keep on bending you over day by day. Just look at mid November and correlate to when Ma pissed Xi off."
6171,"They’re good if you’ve got either a shitload of capital to buy a decent stake, or you get in early as shit on something"
6172,"**FCEL**   The only real answer here. You’re gonna see it happen and then think to yourself, wow, a guy n WSB said it was going to happen. And now you’re going to think after reading that, “wow a guy on Wsb said it was going to happen and even said I was going to have this exact inner dialogue as I think  back to that day."
6173,China don't care about baba. They care about china. That's why china 2nd. China has no freedom. Merica has freedom.
6174,"Honestly, AC origins and odyssey. Maybe the newest one too but haven't played it"
6175,"We thought bears were dead. Then we thought bulls were dead. But really, mods are dead."

6177,Thank god I closed my baba bull spread today for a small gain.  Still holding 50 shares tho
6178,Jade?  I love royals but I didn’t know they had that too.
6179,ICLN is about to downtrend like \~10%. It's hella overbought right now
6180,"It’s all about mentality. Sure, you may have had a 100% loss, but you can look on the bright side and see you had a -100% profit. And you know what they say, “profit is profit”. Keep your heads up boys."
6181,JD TO THE MOON   GOIN IN SOME ZERO DAYS AT 9:30 GL
6182,That will be a shit show in here once they have options on it.
6183,"A couple of TA methods are used to predict how high price can go when it's in all time high territory but in this case, I just think the fact that you were planning to put in 125k on a weekly was enough for a lot of people to say you're nuts. I doubt anyone would've said anything if you were going to put in a few hundred bucks."
6184,Are we being manipulated or are we manipulating them by being manipulated? 4D.

6204,"I wouldn’t expect a shop would jeopardize their Apple “authorized” status with such low brow shenanigans. I think you’d be safe, but a quick OS reinstall first thing out of the box is really easy to accomplish if it gives you added peace of mind."

6212,"As I said, I don’t rent to  degenerates. Hand-picked a nice family w/ solid jobs. This ain’t a shit shack I’m renting out. Never had an issue and they keep renewing year after year. As housing costs rise, so does rents, but I can use that to negotiate and have a better renter. My bills are locked in so I don’t have to raise the price and I won’t if they’re good renters.  This ain’t rocket science pal. No worse case scenarios here. I could always flip it and take my $260k in equity if I was really in a jamb."
6213,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Apparently A N D E is a banned ticker and I just a fucking warning talking about my favorite old cigs.  This place is crazy sometimes.
6214,AMD 100C 12/18
6215,BIDU has been a winner so far
6216,I meant just based on price. BABA is down over 20% from it's ATH. BIDU is down more than that but its ATH was over 2 years ago so recency bias makes BABA look like a better discount.
6217,"how can you say this not knowing what the IPO price is, if it IPOs on the moon like airbnb, there is very little upside"

6227,The Chinese government actually has power over its corporations
6228,I’ll give it some time but looks like it. He’s actually somewhat similar to MCW.
6229,U.S. trying to break down big tech only gives foreign companies a chance to catch up. Now China is trying to break down their own big tech. Not very smart.

6241,"The real way to do it is to never sell a home. Buy one you like. Rent it out when you move. Buy the next rent out the second. Always keeping your properties. People who can’t save always have to sell a home to buy the next OR they want to level up too quickly and buy a home that’s too expensive so they have to sell the first. Keep buying homes, keep renting them out. You end up with a real estate portfolio without making it a job."
6242,Cause they’re in the US markets through proxy accounts
6243,I didn’t do the downvote thing i’m fucking horny get your tight lil pooper over here
6244,Are mods all out gapeing one another for the holidays
6245,I do. I want some Chinese natives to chime in. It was a question
6246,"Of course they do. If they didn't, it would be a massive arbitrage opportunity and it wouldn't work. You could just buy the stock before the dividend date, get the dividend, then sell it. Actual free money."
6247,I agree but will CLDR price go up or down because of it

6256,Those are stock stocks not autism stocks
6257,Oof Jack Ma that is gonna hurt in the morning
6258,Disagree. Many businesses in blue states have been forbidden from operations by law for close to 10 months now. If you are going to legally ban them then you have to support them. Its not their decision to shut down.
6259,It involves making spreadsheets and staying in the office until midnight every night
6260,I hope so bro.
6261,This man would need like a million in baba shares for it to make that dent in the morning
6262,half Japanese half American. East Asian cultures are much different. govs can come down fucking hard on shit.  like it's actually an existential threat to BABA.

6271,Ty Jack Ma. Very cool
6272,yeah don't trade em. not worth it.
6273,Same here. I just want SPY 370. If the prospect of $2k is enough to get us there then I’m good. After I sell to close I won’t care what happens. Good luck man.
6274,Because it’s electric vehicle run up was retarded.
6275,"For me the thesis for Chinese dominance was the fact that they would never break up their companies. With powers of scale they would dominate AI. If they do break their monopolies, they are fkd. AI doesn’t work without scale"

6287,I can’t wait to have BABA shares at 200 😎
6288,GTFO out of BABA asap boyos. its a fucking chinese stock. reminder luckin coffee went 48 -&gt; $2 a share.  and BABA is still green on the year despite making an enemy out of the most poewrful man in China.

6307,Probably will do it again tomorrow. Someone probably sold a ton of $29’s. I’m just nervous holding my gals over this long weekend.
6308,"That would lose a ton too. It’s an opportunity cost. Say he lost 10% and it’s like down 6k which you are like but he’ll eventually make it back, etc. In that time frame it takes for him to make it back, he coulda made 10k elsewhere."
6309,You see that right there is why I don't buy Chinese stocks. Nio Xpeng Li too risky.

6313,"Exactly, ppl always hate on google, Twitter, Amazon etc.  But if we regulated them heavily then we’d have foreign companies step in and take their place.  The bigger a company is, the more influence it has. US uses big tech as an extension of the govt in a clandestine way"
6314,Why would it?  Without stimulus passing Apple going back down quick. Anyone who bought into the EV rumor deserves it honestly. They are not making a car. They will be sourcing out their tech to a EV car company. The real gamble is who will be that EV company....
6315,"Yeah, and it’s completely bullshit"

6331,Why the fuck would you drop MSFT leaps
6332,Yeah I understand that but at least there’s a way to get his money back. With calls if you’re wrong you’re wrong and you’re not recovering that money again. With shares he would just have a paper loss he could gain back with CC’s
6333,"So, I started this on late July, from then with 7k to now with 18k  Along the way my mom heard me talking to a friend and gave me 10k around September which are now 17.5k   Now my GF, HER MOM AND BROTHER are begging me to accept their money.  Fuck this shit everybody wants to be a millionaire but no one wants to take the risk"

6340,MM’s trying to scare me out of AMD ima buy more instead
6341,"This is more about setting an example with Jack Ma. Obviously they care about the tech but they don’t give two shits about your market cap. And why would they want a private company to have all that power. It’s not government owned, if they cross the line they’ll just get destroyed."
6342,I have $17 000 dollars in BABA calls fuck my stupid life. After all these days it finally drips through a major support its bounced off like 4 times in after hours? This shit is so fucking rigged and I'm pissed.

6357,If STIC becomes BARKbox I believe it’ll be a ticker I’ll hold
6358,"Yea I got what you are saying. It looks like he has super long dated leaps (he has like 300k worth from his below post), so I guess he should treat them like shares and sell CCs with shorter dated options to get something back. No idea why one would go all in on one stock though."
6359,"lol well don't put it in for too long. If Pooh wants to shut down that company, he can find a way."
6360,Trav? What are you 11
6361,BABA is making me feel like I have a gambling problem
6362,"The declaration of a dividend naturally encourages investors to purchase stock. Because investors know that they will receive a dividend if they purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date, they are willing to pay a premium. This causes the price of a stock to increase in the days leading up to the ex-dividend date. In general, the increase is about equal to the amount of the dividend, but the actual price change is based on market activity and not determined by any governing entity.  On the ex-date, investors may drive down the stock price by the amount of the dividend to account for the fact that new investors are not eligible to receive dividends and are therefore unwilling to pay a premium.2﻿ However, if the market is particularly optimistic about the stock leading up to the ex-dividend date, the price increase this creates may be larger than the actual dividend amount, resulting in a net increase despite the automatic reduction. If the dividend is small, the reduction may even go unnoticed due to the back and forth of normal trading.  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp#:~:text=After%20a%20stock%20goes%20ex,price%20in%20the%20short%2Dterm."

6389,English mf do u speak it
6390,Idk Apple has been trying to get back into the China market hard core. China has all but abondoned the iPhone. Could be a possible 4d chess move to partner with NIO and bring their cars here to america. Not to mention Team Titan has been spotted at the NIO plant
6391,BABA shares are literally a steal at these prices
6392,Remember a post a long time ago about publicly traded companies engaged in the slave trade?  As in if you invested the amount of slaves brought from Africa to the new world would make you money?  Investing in China is the modern equivalent.

6406,But market cap is good for a capitalist economy. And Xi is the first Chinese leader to understand the power of capitalism and use it to his advantage. Cant see them dominating anything with a state owned “BABA”. Their chances of expanding out of China would be close to zero

Was down $1.5k at today’s close. Bought ROKU puts (I don’t know why I did) and immediately lost $1.8k in value in 30 minutes.  ON THE OTHER HAND:  Bought SQ yesterday (perfect play), but paperhanded in the morning for $100 gain which grew up to be a $7k gain if I just held on. Sold ETSY W AAPL calls which grew 3-4x after on an average after I sold. Seriously! I don’t believe my luck 😔😔😔😔😔😔"

6474,Haha you have me beat. I know it’s not much compared to worse situations. Lol well before I started playing weeklies I recovered about 85% of my losses in 2-3 months (about 15 k) now I’m back to 50% all time maybe less in the span of two days.
6475,Yeah I should consider that. I’m up $27k up in a few months of trading so not too bad I guess but these have been the highlights of bad decisions.

6477,"True, but in reality it’s not that important(or important at all). Also, the AI BABA uses has nothing to do with expanding out of China. Which other country would ever want a Chinese company tracking people’s social scores and lending them money?  If BABA steps over the line, it can be sacrificed and there won’t be any harm beyond wsb talking more shit about Chinese stocks. Another company will soon rise and replace its place within China."

6498,"Good job bud, you profited on a risky play. The more risky plays you make, the more you put yourself out there to lose. Most people don’t have risk tolerance which makes sense on why most people buy and hold long term or only participate thru their 401ks."

6504,I legit think BABA will recover a lot sooner...this is just Xi fucking with Jack Ma

6506,"$wish revenue was $1.9B in 2019, with only a $12B market cap.  When it starts getting some looks it is going to run up, 25-30 / share with a couple months. Good looking to whoever called that out earlier today. I bought july spreads for minimal risk/ big reward on any pop"

In my country the stock market is like a mythical beast, no one here even believes it exists.  I’ve told them to open their own accounts and I can recommend some stuff but they don’t want to deal with the hassle, same as my mom, don’t wanna know anything about it they just want more money.  Now don’t get me wrong I love this place but I’m not that much of a degenerate, I have pretty much everything on long stocks that I bought months ago: DIS, ICLN, ARKK, MGM, BRKB, NCLH, JETS, I don’t yolo or play calls/puts unless I’m Selling them for theta gains.  But I had MGM calls when they announced the COVID vaccine and told them bout GME some time ago so now they think I’m the next warren buffet"
6535,Explain the last week then?  Every time SPY goes on a run his dumbass does something to tank it. 3/3 in past 8 trading days he has single handedly dropped the market. Come on man.

6542,So not the move?
6543,they're actively making a public gesture of compliance which should help to mitigate some of the damage.  Asian culture is strongly about saving face.  when Ma publicly challenged the state of China it's a much more aggressive move than here where free speech means that type of talk is relatively common. that statement is a step in the right direction. it's more about just the compliance. it's about the subservience.

6548,I mean what are the chances I open baba calls today out of all days and that’s the stock I choose
6549,"This BABA thing will be fascinating to watch. Either Xi will break up China’s largest and most prominent tech company purely out of spite, in which case, it’ll just go to show why China will never overtake the US. Alternatively, the CCP huffs and puffs a little, slaps a fine on the wrist, and Jack Ma comes out with his giant dick swinging, looking like a goddamn hero.   I am long in shares and will be adding in the dip."

6565,"Very good question there Vgreen07. Yes, after a huge drop you should buy puts. Inversely, when a stock has already rocketed up, you should buy calls. This will put money into theta gang so they can continue eat well."

6630,"Something no one is talking about but is very important for stocks is the Jan. 5 senate runoff.

6632,I bought a bunch of 165 strike expiring LOW calls at 0.1 per. Did this on the first dip of the day hoping it would rebound into close but they still have potential to do something. Tomorrow might be a little loopy.

6684,"Apple had a good relationship with China because they could use children, prisoners, oppressed minorities, etc. Also, they had solid police state that kept everybody in line. In addition, they had the infrastructure: power, transportation, etc.   If you look outside China, it’s very hard to find similar places. Africa will either be lacking the infrastructure or keeping people from burning the place down (like what happened in India).   They can actually make their stuff in a stable country but that will cost them a bit more. Tim Apple has to make some difficult choices."

6755,"People are missing the real benefit of stimulus. Yes, the news of stimulus moves the market with money that already exists. But half the benefit of stimulus is the actual printing of money/check getting sent to Americans, some percent of which will be put into the market.  Based on Mitt Romney's famous 47% of Americans pay taxes quote, let's go with 150 million people getting stimulus checks. 150m x 600 x 20% invested = $18 billion added to the market. 150m x 2000 x 33% invested = $100 billion added to the market.  I'm upping the percentage invested because as the amount increases, so should the amount that people consider expendable/investable.   So don't be a paper-handed little bitch over the holidays and wait for that sweet stimmy money to actually hit the market in the coming weeks."

6770,based on what i've seen its the social aspect of it that people love. one would say pton might be more of a  software/social company rather than a bike company. at the end of the day any bike company can put a cheap display onto a bike. its the software/social aspect that they can't replicate.  now imagine if pton allows trainers to broadcast private paid workouts on the pton platform with pton getting a %..kind if like zooms marketplace.. that would send the stock to $100B.

7115,It's ok. I calculated my losses at $230 and it's about $55k which I can afford to lose.  It's not great ofcourse and with my losses on XPEV calls I think will end my time trying to play Chinese stocks.  Thankfully I think my gains on QQQJ and ICLN are going to offset this pretty quickly.

Check actual stocks in those indexes overnight too to make sure there’s correlation. If stocks are mixed expect some dips.

7339,So what does this mean for other Chinese companies such as Nio? Asking for a friend who’s has 75% of his ira in Nio
7340,"I’m not underestimating anything. The reason that I didn’t come close to buying the dip on Baba is precisely I know their tentacles have stretched too far. The only point I’m “arguing” is the idea that only Chinese companies and only Baba are susceptible antitrust probes. I’d like to believe that’s the case with buying calla in tech behemoths. But the reality is that the bigger they get and more efficient they are carving out the markets, the more governments will come at them. No matter where they are and under which flags they fly."

7391,You have shares. What are you worrying about? Cathie Wood is buying more of BABA everytime it dips. Stop trading and start investing. Think about it like this. Why would you buy a house for 500k and sell it for 400k just because the market says it is worth 400k? Do you like the house? Why did you buy the house in the first place? What was the plan?
7392,"PERI, F L N T, MGNI. Buy in dips, make money as they fly to Valhalla. It’s simple money at this point.

This suffering will make you stronger and mold you into a greater version of yourself. I know that you feel inadequate! I know how fucking painful it is to endure such suffering.    But you, you are strong enough to weather the storm. You must come to realize that *you* are the *answer.* YOU ARE THE ANSWER. Only you can put all of the pieces together.   Work on yourself, focus on yourself, and discover who you are! Get away from the internet. It has poisoned your mind. Take a break from the distractions of this world and take a walk. Take everything in. Come to reality.  I want you to do something. Something about your suffering. Seek therapy, study, work out, discover a new hobby, clean your house. Anything that will serve as a step towards the light. I highly advise seeking therapy!  I know that you don't want to. That you feel depressed, distressed, dejected, hopeless. I want you to fucking force yourself if you have to. You are valuable and I want you to tell that to yourself every single fucking day. No one else's opinion matters because *you* are the key.  The answer lies within you. Once you find that, or at least take the steps to, the rest will follow."

7754,"A lot of European companies are also jumping on the EV train. Does that mean Europe is evil and we shouldn't trust Europe neither? Bottom line is that there is increased competition coming from China and Europe and this only serves to give consumers more choices. Nobody is forcing you to buy any specific country's product. Consumers will gravitate to their favorite products regardless where it's made. So to me, I want the increased competition because I want Tesla and Apple to keep pushing for better products and to stay ahead of their competition in European and China. When there is no threat of competition, there is stagnation. In stagnation, companies produce garbage products because they know you have no choice but to buy their garbage products."

7863,😄 pretty well nailed it. Centrally planned economies dont work. I dont know how many times this has to be demonstrated before it sinks in. I honestly thought the CCP was so focused on growth that they would allow their companies free rein.  I have a fairly large position in BABA and NIO so my fingers are crossed the the CCP comes to their senses.
7864,"So, I’m kinda bummed out thinking that volatility is going to be much less ummm volatile in 2021?  Will make this sub, and life in general, less exciting.   Someone just tell me volatility isn’t going away, and we are gonna do it all over again in March 2.0??"

7878,"I have TD as well &amp; I can’t find it on there either. When I go to sell common shares, you click “reduce position”, click the drop down under “type”, &amp; the bottom option is a trailing stop. Very easy to find.  When I go to sell options on TD, you click “reduce position”, and there’s options for stop limits but not trailing stop limits  If you don’t mind explaining like I’m five (or retarded), how exactly do you set trailing stops on options on TD? I would use TD exclusively if I were able to do so."

7900,What did the info say?
7901,"Like you, I'm becoming increasingly worried. I thought $250 was the floor for sure.  At this point, I'm not sure what it's going to fucking do. I have shares and leaps. Don't wanna bag hold forever.   I was hoping for a wick rebound to $300s by early 2021. Not so sure now"
7902,That’s a great attitude to have man. Well done.... you sure you’re in the right place? Lol  About 13 mill btw.

At least go up on the hype if they can generate it the coming years before release."
7908,Haven't smelled a woman's ass in way too long and it's hurting my trades.
7909,I'm so with you on this.  I wanted to put that BABA money into the connected TV ad space which is also rocketing up.  I'm just thankful I didn't go in more which I really really almost did when BABA hit the mid 250s where it seemed to have really strong support.  Two stocks that are way up buy probably have more room to run is MGNI and PERI.  If MGNI pulls back under 30 then I would get some.  It's likely going to the 40s.  It just got pumped on CNBC.  PERI also in digital ad space.  Way undervalued.  Small market cap especially for it's revenue.  It's like going to get bid to the 20s just because it's so cheap.  The digital ad space isn't doing anything like the solar/ev space though because that's all story time imagination world.

7926,Futures don't trade like stocks.  You're buying Points difference from where you enter. Each point 1 point gain or loss will cost $50/contract and $5/contract for Mini-S&amp;P  So you need to have an exit strategy if you're trading futures

7937,that's only 50% loss.. people here routinely sit at a 99% loss and believe it can turn around.
7938,If you're holding long then after this little correction you might see a decent bounce back when they announce earnings in February.  Because I'm sure as usual they will be stellar and BABA at $220 or wherever it ends up will look too cheap to most people.  And if BABA is $220 Feb 1 then I'll buy back in...
7939,"You'd have to argue that we're ""taxed without representation"" since that's why we broke from the Brits. Luckily, it's fairly easy to argue that since the entirety of Congress is loyal to corporate lobbyists and business interests, we truly are not represented by our Congresspeople."

7948,Why is Winnie the Pooh so upset at BABA? Because he called them out on their shit?
7949,F
7950,"Crazy how the bullshit stories we tell ourselves dictate our fate. Some idiot was convinced BABA was way overvalued at 300 and has shorted it all the way down to 230, while thousands of intelligent dip buyers are now impoverished bag holders"
7951,Sorting by best has the funniest shit. Some guy said to defund the mods. 🤣

Congrats on seeing through the bullshit."""
7994,I think this is different.  It's a bona fide anti-trust investigation.  I mean it's already so cheap you would think it can't go much lower... but this really is the 5th time in about 6 weeks baba holders have been screwed.  many are leaving and never coming back.

8024,I think that is a safe bet honestly. Online sports betting can literally only keep gaining in popularity - especially as casinos are changed for the near term.  DKNG and PENN are perfectly positioned for this year and DKNG below $51 is a good entry point because they seem to be bottoming around $50 right now

8096,"I end up buying back my calls either EOD or the next morning depending on price action. I don't like holding CC's on TSLA overnight usually because it easily gaps up 3% without blinking  I have 100 shares and when premiums are low, what I usually do is wait for TSLA to go up intraday and try to find the daily high - sell a close to ATM call and buy it back when it looks like it is starting to bottom out.   I try to time the entry but not the exit, in this way I am basically just trying to generate some spare cash to cover the cost of holding 100 shares through crazy up/down swings  If TSLA ultimately goes up - I have further reduced my cost basis, and if it goes down I hopefully have a CC that is written to collect the premium against the loss on my shares.  It probably sounds retarded but it has worked OK for me this year. DO NOT sell CC's when TSLA is squeezing. Wait for that climax then try to write a further OTM call that you might be able to hold till expiry in that situation. All other times I have to go somewhat close to ATM otherwise the premiums are negligible.  Shortest expiry possible usually because I never know where the top on TSLA is"

I converted a NAV Spac lord and I’ve come fully back and am up 20%. The trick is to find spacs that have already announced a merger. You can produce option esque gains while knowing your exact risk and targeting ones with 10-20%.  Problem is with current rules on the sub any DD posted for these spacs get deleted bc the market cap isn’t big enough. The mods are chucking you of major gains while limiting your downside risk from 100% to 10-20%. I made an IG account that’s posting the general consensus picks of Spac gang, @spac_station.  You can choose to consider this spam or you can choose to check it out and change that red into green. Oh, and you can still be autistic while doing these plays, I just made my last position fully on margin.

8232,I’m riding the bull till the end of January. Then I plan on buying a bunch of VIX 30c for 4/19 and 5/17. Either they expire worthless or there’s a correction. I think the VIX is going down to 16-18. When a correction hits it’ll shoot to 40-45 maybe spike above that. But a bottom will form and we’ll have a big buying opportunity.   I’m not predicting it exactly or anything. I just think we’re getting closer to a top by end January-February.   If I miss a month of gains and it corrects in March or April ok fine. It’s definitely coming some time in 2021.
8233,At this point its almost hard to believe how fuckin gay the mods are
8234,AMZN will go down by 0.63% and continue to slowly fuck me with miniature red dildos
8235,I think I’m going to do the same thing. I think it’s a fools errand to wait for any sort of dip. I just keep watching it ARKK go up.
8236,RH is trash. Find another broker. You're worth it
8237,Living in projects with a Bentley   Wait seen that
8238,So the trend in Cohen’s filling suggest he bought around 3/4 million shares per day in the 3 days leading up to the filling. He’s building his ownership fast.
8239,A strong company won’t drop like that unless true rug pull comes into play
8240,WTF are you even saying you fucking retarded retard??
8241,ZJZ shit posting on alts to make it seem like we need moderation or have we been living in a protected bubble?
8242,"So does Apple, Tesla, and Nike"
8243,"Gambler like the rest of y'all, I need genuine advice with BABA.  Will it be fine in the long term?  Should i sell at open and buy back lower?  Or just ditch the fuck out of BABA?  I don't know what to do, but thankfully I'm in it for the long haul so i only check my portfolio once a week or so"
8244,Believable.   Have a great day.
8245,That trash isn’t going anywhere. Don’t be a fool
8246,this is why the american public is easily manipulated  you are contributing to the disease you fucking brain dead ape
8247,I think you just missed it with XL but STIC maybe
8248,"I agree but I wonder what influence they have over china and even if they have some would they use their political capital to keep it's value up?   The other thing is that they probably bought in at a really low cost basis-- I remember one fidelity dude got it at like .07 cents a share?  Danoff received 46,154 Alibaba shares that cost $3,432, or 7 cents apiece, according to an annual report filed by his family’s private charitable foundation. The cheap stock reflects how F-Prime made an investment in Alibaba about 15 years before the company went public."
8249,Weird flex but I see you King.
8250,Not sure what you mean. Conservatism is held together by me not wanting to give you my money. That mindset isn't going anywhere. You'll get it once you meet enough useless fucks
8251,Magnite on a real run here
8252,How do the Cathy club feel about her buying BABA now ?
8253,"No it’s gonna be fiscal AND monetary policy with JPow and Janet at the helm. Inflation is good for growth, it makes people buy things now instead of waiting, and invest rather than save."
8254,"""unless it happens, it's not gonna happen"""
8255,"I mean, no.  CCP can't investigate any of those companies or commandeer the board of directors, so its not similar at all"
8256,"Thanks bro. You’ve been helpful enough. I think I’ll switch over to TOS full time, for that reason specifically. Today, my JD 1/15 $100c’s opened at $.28 &amp; ran as high as $.65.   Without a trailing stop loss option, my choices were either sell or diamond hand them. A trailing stop would’ve allowed me to hold on for upside with the comfort of knowing I’d sell immediately when momentum fades.  I chose the diamond hand option and held them back down to $.47 &amp; now now it’s getting crushed AH/in HK"
8257,Is the trailblazers homer here tonight? Lol his team getting ass blasted I hope you're make money tomorrow to ease some of the pain.

8260,It goes again tomorrow don’t listen to dumb people who don’t know what they’re talking anout. I was in at .56 and sold today but plan to get back in if it has good rsi and volume tomorrow
8261,Has anyone checked one Variation Separate or wtfever his name was to see if he's alive?
8262,the plan is actually so transparent but u see anti-trump rhetoric and get emotional. fuck off retard
8263,I'd SPY can hit 372 tomorrow everyone who comments under me will get nothing. Because I'll still be negative for the year. Rip
8264,Taking bets for how many BABA will drop tomorrow. I’m saying 9% dip by noon then it will go to down 7% by 2 and then down 12% EOD.
8265,We’re both fucked on AMD.  1/22 100c down 60%.  Welcome to hell.
8266,If you're in for the long with shares then this is a clear buying opportunity
8267,Long term BABA will be a $600 stock min.
8268,A spac shill? 🤣. I only take advise from fintok
8269,Y know ‘ol duck cunts a mod right? Pretty active too
8270,If you don’t spend 45 minutes on the toilet at work each day you are missing out.  Literally free money. And I use that time to talk to you retards. So it makes it EXTRA worth it 😉🥰
8271,I'll tell you exactly how. SPCE in q2 20. Your short put gets tested hard. Blown through and you take assignment. Start selling CCs and get assfucked by 2 separate share offerings. Eventually you manage to roll down for credit on a weekly basis and exit in q3 at a unsatisfying profit.  Ask me how I know.
8272,One bag of that and one bag of their vegetable fried rice and you have a meal + leftovers
8273,I don't know about you but I'm sure enjoying it

8280,Dude your chart mediocre as fuck lmao   I was ready to be impressed but damn was that a letdown
8281,"Well if the CCP really ""fucks up"" BABA like all these bears and anti-china people are saying, the repercussions would be that all these giant American titans with all the big money will just pull all their money out of China and we're really gonna see a gigantic global market crash lol  Every country with stock exchanges are competing for investor's money. Personally I don't think China is dumb enough to shoot itself in the foot. But who knows. Maybe they will. There's been a lot of dumbass-ery and fuckery going on in 2020 lol."
8282,"Educate a smooth brained retard, what does this mean?  I'm trying to get a feel for futures but it's beyond me."

8285,"Remember all them times GameStop gave you $1.40 for your used n64 game, well we’re finally even you fucking snakes   GME 🚀"
8286,"lol i'm not saying i disagree or that it's a bad strategy.  just that your comment amounts to saying ""a stock won't go down unless it does,"" which is pretty meaningless tbh"
8287,Is that a problem?
8288,I debate on buying the “nice” pasta for $1 more a pack at the grocery store but somehow am unfazed losing hundreds a day on YOLOs. Makes perfect sense
8289,I think this could be an interesting flashpoint in china. For example I know their middle class likes spending money and alibaba is their amazon. So if their overlords want to take away their main shop and maybe even a place that has well paying jobs it's the taste of capitalism v the old guard
8290,Not debatable. Apple and Microsoft IV way lower than CCL and NIO  The “downside risk” is part of the volatility that defines how much you get paid to sell the option. By definition if you find a company with much higher premiums it’s going to have more volatility on average (at least expected)
8291,Peanut Butter Falcon is actually a solid movie
8292,I know it’s free trendies shares
8293,15 minutes until my Christmas bonus hits my account. About to buy up some random Chinese spa company at open and hope it goes up 300%.
8294,"That's for being un-american and choosing to lose money on a Gyna stonk, instead of a US one. /s"
8295,"I know that you have had a ton of comments on this already, and I am not an OG member, but you are definitely under appreciated and I am interested in being a part of any communities you may go to after this. I hope that you all are able to work this out and I will see your hand in things on this sub soon."
8296,"Just be warned, a Trailing stop LIMIT on low liquidity options, or volitile options is extremely risky  It has to be a market order and you have to pray that the options chain doesn't freak out and trigger it. If it blows through the limit price you are smoked and it won't actually trigger/execute  It is not a 100% reliable safety net. Common shares absolutely but stay alert."
8297,Ain’t slowing down either
8298,Wasn’t trump going to delist them in like a week? Or did they flake ?
8299,Riding Cohen dck so hard
8300,"Lmao no, these are half drunk thoughts. I work normal hours fortunately."
8301,I usually use a pencil when I commit sudoku
8302,"Because option prices fluctuate the way they do, I’d prefer to set a trailing stop of 1-2% on a green spike/gap up, as opposed to just selling straight up. Without them, it’s kinda an ‘all or nothing’ type of situation So I really Appreciate it bro"
8303,Yeah who fucking knows. I think it’s worth noting that at all these major corrections VIX has been around 12-13 or near ATL. We’re a ways off that. Which may mean nothing at all honestly. I may just ride the bull and hedge with something similar to what you’re doing maybe a little farther out
8304,"The real reason Jack Ma is “under investigation” is the Chinese government manufactured a billionaire that is a complete idiot. Watch his interviews, he would likely be better at heading a family farm or teaching school to the totally illiterate.   Not a good look for the fine wine sipping commie leadership."
8305,i get why cramer says wsb should be monitored. you guys are the true lifeblood of the american disenfranchised and poor
8306,I have a woman crush on Cathie Wood...eeeeek I’m gay!
8307,That's what I thought too. Their government has stayed in power with the carrot and stick method. They give just enough prosperity to keep people in the game and enough social engineering to keep them from straying. The whole hong kong crackdown last year really showed them losing their total grip on their people.
8308,Just buy a Chinese massage parlor  Those will print tendies till the end of time
8309,"Thanks, if my portfolio wasn't already so BABA heavy I would definitely buy more.  Good luck soldier"
8310,"I just spent a couple hours exploring this website that lists all the SPACs.

Maybe I can get into one of these meme tickers before the rest of you  for once.  WEED + TECH + E-COMMERCE + SPAC = 🚀"
8311,Heard it's now up to 600
8312,"We always have.  There's a battle between people like zjz who want to mostly let people be and automate the janitor work, the current lead mods who want to pussyfoot around and suppress irresponsible advice, and the likes of chainsaw_vasectomy who is true chaotic neutral.

8314,"Merry Christmas everyone. I love you and thanks for the great year trading.    If you're new here, fuck off and go to r/investing; this isn't your place.    Fellow retards, let's keep our collective tard strength solid into the new year and may we all be blessed by the God's tendies"
8315,"Unless they kidnap Jack like all the others, I am not worried."
8316,G HIV gonna make me a shit load of tendies. 15c x 50
8317,I agree. I guess longevity wise selling CSP on strong companies is a solid method
8318,"I know I’m beating a dead horse but wsb is gonna get prettty bad if it’s anything like when zjz disabled mod bots back in October to shut up the haters (me lol).   Not to sound like a absolute flamer, but some of you guys are okay. I have enjoyed talking to some of you and shitposting with more of you. We’re gonna lose some folks here for a while if not forever. I wish everyone luck in trading and their lives."

8331,Took me about 5 minutes to understand the question. Must be why my portfolio is so red.
8332,I think I remember it was you who was trying to buy in the CVAC ipo a few months ago but couldn't figure how or if you should do it. Seemed like you didn't know shit back then lol you've come a long way

8337,"I’m a tard, as you might be able to gather. I personally think the hopeful continued Cohen buying, shortened trading day, and kickoff to Santa time rocket will cause the shorts to scramble. I am curious to see how the shorts move, especially considering tomorrow is the final day of that FCC 13 day rule about selling without shares. (Search around for the official DD in the sub)"
8338,^ you ain't lying.  It's about circling the wagons with our boys resignation tonight.    Let's not lose focus of what made this sub great.  I'm doubling down like with $PLTR
8339,I averaged down on my 12/31 94c today. I feel like we are going to bounce back tomorrow. Buying the dip and selling at new ATH has been the play lately.

8368,"If you are trading you are in trouble, if you are investing this a great time to lower your cost basis. Remember to ask yourself why you invested in BABA.

8426,So is China just realizing how powerful and devastating a big tech monopoly could be to their hold on power over their citizens?  Seems like they only want to do this anti monopoly stuff to ensure their own power. They’ve seen how much pull large companies in the US have or could potentially have over government officials. They don’t want outside corruption in their already corrupt government.   Maybe this is an outlandish drunken thought. Feel free to let me know.

Trade in seeing 200% gain in one day but a chance at -100% in one month for 35+% gain in a couple weeks with -10-20% risk. It’s literally the smarter and more calculated gamble.

9491,"Why? They didn't cause it. They contained it as best they could. At most you could probably say they should have been more transparent and people lower down the chain should be reprimanded for trying to hide the outbreak initially. The Chinese government didn't cover it up, some low level Chinese government officials tried to hide it from their higher ups which then had to come in and fix their mess.  China then went on to manufacture and distribute PPE, respirators and other key equipment. Sending it to Europe and other smaller countries that needed the aid.  Don't get me wrong. We should hate the Chinese government for many atrocities they have committed against racial minorities, quelling dissent and generally being authoritarian cunts but this isn't their fault and making this the thing you go after them for cheapens the pain and suffering of those that really got fucked by China."

9618,"Oh, you are British. 20p it is.  Jk. So here it is - stonks only go up. A $40c 12/25 is a call option that expires 12/25.  It actually is a 12/24, because the markets aren’t open on 12/25, but anyway, we’ll go with it. It is very OTM so it is cheap. Out of The Money. So it’s a fully kamikaze move.  Nobody but an absolute fucking moron would buy that. PLTR isn’t hitting $40 tomorrow.  Except, every once in a while that play will work.  And you get lucky as shit and somehow end up with a 10,000% ROI. But don’t start off with that stupid shit.   The opposite of that is 20p that’s a $20 put option. You are betting on the price going down.  You only do this if you are a bear.  And as we know, all bears are gay bears.  Now, rather than buying calls and puts, you can also sell calls and puts.  This is pretty much where theta gang lives and they are also gay.  But more like in the shadows about it.  Like gay vampires.  And pretty much anything else you hear about like an iron condor or a faggy butterfly or a flaming mosquito (I’m just making up shit at this point) is a combination of those 4 things buying or selling puts or calls."

9621,"Read a few comments, realized you need a crash course. Here we go.  Step 1: Download RH, link bank account, enable options,  ignore warnings.  Step 2: Load up all the cash ~~you're willing to lose~~ you need to make yourself rich.  Step 3: ??????  Step 4: PROFIT!!!  There are many ways to make money.  1: Shares. You buy a share, it's yours! It's worth what it's worth. It goes up and down. Buy low and hold or sell high and pay taxes.  2: Buy Call options. This is a contract to buy 100 shares of company X at price Y, before a certain date. The contract costs a certain amount. You can sell the contract or execute it (buy the shares at the reserved price). For example, let's say I think PLTR will be worth $33 or higher by March of 2021. I can buy a $33 call option (the right to buy 100 shares at $33 per share), expiring in March, for a certain price... let's say $400. So you pay $400 for the right to buy 100x PLTR at $33 by March. If it hits $40 by March, you make 100x the difference (40-33=7x100=$700). If PLTR fails to reach $33, you loss the full cost of the contract (-$400).  3. Buy Put options. Same as buying calls, only you're betting the price will go down. A put means your willing to sell a stock at a certain price. If it goes below that price, you make 100x the difference.   4. Sell call/put options. Stay away from selling anything unless you know what the fuck you're doing. Just don't.   5. Start small, lose it. Start small again, lose it. Start small again, big win, pro style, Chad trades. Bankrupt. Now you're ready."

9675,"I just see no value in it now. It’s kind of similar to how the perceived value of sports diminishes as you age.  When you’re young it’s beneficial to have ambiguous exercise like that — spending energy very broadly, whether that’s mentally in a video game or physically in a sport, promotes growth and development.  Once you mature though and no longer need the larger more ambiguous energy spending to develop, you refine your focus to the things that generate the best return on your time. Like thinking about or working on a work project or doing DD on a play you are thinking about making.  There just isn’t the same benefit to you as an adult so your interest fades."

9873,the question isn't will BABA come back.  its WHEN???  Because I've held this piece of shit for 2 months now when I could have used the money for so many other plays.  Should someone really tie up their cash now and then hold it in BABA for at least the next 6 weeks before you see any life come back?

9946,Has this thread replaced all of your social media or is it just me
9947,Now it makes sense why I was banned for telling everyone to shut the fuck up about him cramer
9948,I would argue that depends on the person. I put myself through a top 10 school and eventually landed an office job at a huge manufacturing company and get paid quite well. But the whole time i was in school I struggled w that shit. people have strengths and weaknesses you might not expect

9954,"it's literally been buy anywhere on red, even on a terrible entry and you get bailed out by the market less than 24 hours later for days and days and days.  there have been so many v-recoveries in the last couple weeks on all  the indices that it seems like we're in less ""retail is buying every dip"" territory and more ""institutions are training retail to buy every dip so when the drawdown comes they'll be sure to have buyers every step of the dump"" territory."

9957,This thread is so fucking weird at night
9958,yup.  Intel isn't the only when getting fucked in the server space now.  Everyone focused on AMD eating Intel's lunch.  They didn't notice everyone else coming to eat Intel AND AMD's lunch.

9994,Great way to teach accountability. Dont stick your hand in the spinny metal blades.  If they do it. Lesson learned.
9995,Everything depends on the person obviously.  Some people just aren't smart enough to get a good job.  Any idiot can just not shoot drugs into his arm.  They ain't the same.

10008,this isnt a small issue.  Xi views what baba as a threat to the CCP. He is going to make an example out of him. It's not an eye for an eye. It's drag you through the streets for a year and make sure you beg for forgiveness. On top of that you have the US also fucking with asian equities through the audit stuff. Baba will recover but I don't think this is the bottom.

10060,Damn my brain is going a million miles per hour. This covid shit has been giving me an existential crisis. It’s crazy how vulnerable human life really is. I just wish I was closer with my family in this present moment. 2021 goals I guess...if we even make it

10076,I’ve done that...  but it always has a negative in front of it... I think my RH is broken...
10077,"still holding mine cuz its locked with my broker ( ticker change). idk how i feel about it lmao, but diamond hands is good?"
10078,"You son of a bitch, I'm in"
10079,Yeah who would pay for that when you can just get a plastic suit on Aliexpress for 5 USD
10080,Living proof this sub is filled with retards that can't read. It's at the top.
10081,Yes I was a bit disheartened when the dip happened around 10:30 but I’m glad I kept it strong.
10082,"How exactly does buying puts forces institutions to sell stock? I got the part where we should buy shares in defense, but sold puts are cash secured, right? If exercised they force MMs to buy stock at a shit price, is that how they drive it down? Buy ITM put, exercise it?"
10083,"Good job! If you’re looking for a next move, VGAC 😉"
10084,You're not wrong
10085,I’m also not sure if I should hold it out until tomorrow or if I should cash it out.   I know pre market can be brutal or nice depending on anything . I’m eating myself to see if I should cash out within the hour before market close or not
10086,My only regret is I didn't put more into it. I bought this morning before the first big jump and have been holding still.  Almost bought a few calls since I expected it to rise. Fuck my retarded ass for not doing that.
10087,All in Short Stepp los 71$
10088,"Wait, isn't this not enough to post for stock gains?"
10089,WE'LL FUCKING DO IT AGAIN 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
10090,A put is selling a stock.
10091,The same way buying calls force the .the hedge by buying a portion of those 100 stocks....just inversie-doopsies to put it technically
10092,I’m in ! Fuck it lets go!
10093,It's always the stocks I've never heard of.
10094,My theory was while I wont get 1k every day- having 1.6k invested- this was abnormal. But even gaining 50-100 a day or maybe 300 a week if playing safley means some income that I otherwise wound have as college student.
10095,"I’m in, got a 12/31 $68.5 pooter for $1.72"
10096,David vs Goliath. They so underestimate us.
10097,Some one give this retard a reward  Don’t be a paper handed 🐻
10098,I'd sell half to feel good with some money in my pocket then try to repeat the success
10099,"They are so fucked, they have tried to manipulate by waiting for low volume then dumping on it like fucking tards. Too bad they are wearing shorts, so they are just shitting their pants leading up to a fat fucking squeeze on monday. These tards won't know what hit them, Anyone holding now will be shitting tendies in a week."
10100,"Fuck it, dropping all this weeks GME profits into this. Your fault if my family doesn’t eat on Christmas though"
10101,good tip is to enter the contract with the most volume so you can have an easier exit. in this case $68s are better than 68.5
10102,So retarded I bought a 31$ put thinking that was the position.
10103,I doubt I’m gonna have a hard time exiting this option but in general yea
10104,Should of taken a shit on it
10105,I haven’t been able to hold my shits in since getting fucked in the ass by Jay Farner CEO of Quicken Loans .   God damn RKT calls.
10106,Do they realize how dumb we are? Our MO is diamondhand until shit expires worthless and we only sell on fun numbers like 69 or 420  🚀🚀🚀🚀
10107,I’m not gonna lie. I’m feeling as powerful as the time George soros shorted 1 billion in a single day  Times 5
10108,I'm staying strong. Added 2k shares on top of my 4500 at the bottom this morning. Now I can't stop checking the stock price. This anxiety is going to pay off bigly.
10109,So what GME calls should we be buying today to hit them back?
10110,"It’s too late now, next time tell us before the jump"
10111,and if they do then you're the genius of course
10112,You could prob net ~10k a week with 350k selling puts...
10113,100% ready to bury these fucks in the center of the earth and launch into a black hole to reach the other side of the universe 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
10114,"Wow, so I’ve made a few thousand so far and been lucky that I cut losses when I did. When you started really making money on this, did you load up on a few tickers or did you spread it out?"
10115,Become a millionaire. All in on OPEN. If you want to play it safe go for shares. With that capital you’ll be 7 figures 2021
10116,“I’ve never made money on put options”  Here’s all you need to know fellow retards
10117,You've never made money on puts.   Crash baby crash Aex 320p march...I can't recall too many dates have gone before..crash baby crash
10118,"If that's a spread, it's a brilliant one."
10119,Exactly! I’ll hook you up with a smooth handy behind the lambo dealership if it works though 😘
10120,"lol you're right I should've just stopped at ""I've never made money on put options"""
10121,Lol you and me same. I woke my ass at 9 and saw this and just put in everything I had available 1.6k  Then it lost 20% in 5 min in 10:25 and I kicked my self for not taking it out. Then I fell asleep cause I work up unnaturally early at 9 am. Now I look at it and see +1k and I’m just like hol up  Are you planning to keep it until tomorrow or cash out?
10122,"It's really true. Here's the thing-- this short position is SUPER risky because of it's depth and breath already-- but if they have a black swan event (like Cohen doing something wild), they're risking ruin. Bad move, shorts.   shares, 25/30 calls for 12/31"
10123,"Be careful doing spreads on RH, they have a tendency to close them early and saddle you with the losses."
10124,"Until something like june/september happens, then it’s back to the alley behind Wendy’s"

10128,From the 5 minutes of DD I did on them they seem solid so I may hold. Then again tomorrow is Christmas Eve and shit always seems to go south. Might cash in if I’m up and buy the dip later. I’m expecting people to take their wins or cash losses for tax reasons up till 2021

10151,"I’m gonna help you morons who don’t get how spreads work on Robinhood.   Robinhood tries to buy/sell at the average price for the option when you select a spread. If no ones willing to buy/sell at the average then your strategy will take a long time (possible never) to get filled/only get filled partially.   Ex: if your stupid fucking option has a bid/ask that’s .50 cents wide you’re never gonna get filled. Odds are if one leg gets filled, there’s zero fucking chance the other will come back to get filled.   Imagine the bid is .5 and the ask is 1 on one leg of your option. Robinhood sets you at .75 with no option to edit in a multi leg strat. If the stock rises and your fill gets smacked, it’ll go in the opposite direction for your hedge.   If you’re going to do spreads on Robinhood, buy and sell options manually."

Today is day 12 where it will be listed, tomorrow 13. Once you're listed for 13 days you are required to cover your positions or face fines, so come monday they will be buying a bunch to cover their shorts. In fact, since they shorted at 170% they will not be able to cover all their shorts by definition, so regardless they are getting fined and driving the price through the roof.     You may then ask, since they can't cover them all, won't they just not cover any and eat the fine? No, because it isn't just 1 fund that has that 170%. It'll be a race to the top by all these shorters, to see who can cover and basically reduce their losses first.

10169,Dude do you’re own research.
10170,"Options are extremely cheap right now. I own more shares than contracts but once the stock becomes realized it will moon again. The original pump and dump was with the SPAC, ($SAMA) but the hype died down once people started selling. The second moon will be much larger and the stock will be able to maintain its price."

10175,Have you tried turning it off and then turning it back on again?
10176,V for Volume

10178,excellent  don’t lose it now
10179,""" **Don't try to predict the market, instead predict what the retards will do.** ""  Same shit. The retards are the market. Doesnt matter if they are Boomtards, Millietards or Zoomtards.

10181,"Here's a golden rule my friend. If you have weeklies, sell them at open."
10182,You left out the most vital point... EU/pharma GMP certs are nearly unheard of in the cannabis space right now. And they have one for their Columbia facility.
10183,Think about how wet girls will get when you’re a senior about to graduate and you wake up to a $300k account and straight A’s. Keep it up champ!

10186,"I’ve been in this baby since SAMA.  Growing in Colombia and Portugal year-round with perfect conditions will be soooo much more profitable then building greenhouses in the fucking Canadian Tundra.  Check out their website, sick genomics, distribution, this is the future. The Canadian companies are shit that are living off legalization in Canada in 2001.... times are fucking changing now.   Also Colombia declared them a “strategic industry” i.e. anyone fucks with them they’re sending in the Army.  CLVR to the moon 🚀🚀🚀"

10211,"No one sells the best weed for the cheapest price. I’m not saying you’re wrong but good weed is extremely labor intensive to produce. Anyone can plant a field and let it grow, good buds absolutely need love. That’s said I’m definitely looking into the company, but truly make sure it’s the good shit before loading up..."
10212,"But it’s not. It was useful for blackmarket exposure until they started working with the feds. The app is glitchy, it’s not updated regularly, not everyone’s on it, etc. all online purchasing is being done through Dutchie.com so they end up being the one hosting updated menus, etc. not Weedmaps."
10213,"Not sure, but I feel like it’s always been a good play to buy options on SPACs as soon as they’re available"
10214,"cant argue. i wish you the best dude i just dont have the balls to make the investment at this price. id go into $pltr in a heartbeat if it dips back under $20 but the premium is so high right now. i really do love the long-term play on it, i just dont think you're gonna get the short term pop you expect. hope im wrong tho brother"
10215,"It’s the best shit. They are about to go on major television networks and promote their business, and once that happens it will have already mooned.  The reason it is so cheap is because it is the only cannabis company currently operating in Columbia, where land and labor is extremely cheap and the climate is great year round."
10216,True—- and this stock is so ripe.    And Cohens been successful.  The market has never had a modern national chain with the B&amp;M footprint to serve the vidya market. And omnichannel. Amazon and Newegg sell sooooo much stuff people would rather go pickup same day

(banned ticker) is a better short term meme play imo"
10221,"that i missed these gains? oh ya absolutely, ive been down about 3pts in the same term so i am mad :(  but i do sincerely mean what i said. P/E is over 65 while competitors with magnitudes more revenue are at closer to 30. there are better value plays in the vertical. if you want a great meme stock with real pop potential short term i recommend $g.h.i.v (banned ticker)"

You earn 10K a week typically, but lose 100-300K on that one horrible week(or lose something like 50K on 5 weeks a year).  Theta gang is the definition of ""sounds good, doesn't work"". Not that it doesn't work outright, but theta gangers pretend like it's free money. The black swan crash(or rise up if you're selling calls) can cost you how much you made in dozens of weeks.  Unless you have an edge which most don't, theta gang is not much more profitable than buying options. Most people don't have that edge."

10367,"What we know about the vaccine so far:  It can be stored at higher temperatures, meaning less transportation logistics and costs.  The vaccine will be an inactivated (traditional) type, as opposed to the new mRNA type deployed by Pfizer and Moderna. This is a historically proven method of vaccination. Early clinical trials also show that this causes immunisation to last longer.  It’s also an intranasal vaccine and only one dose is required for up to 12 months efficacy and lesser reactions to the vaccine.  In the Phase I and II clinical trials in India, the vaccine has been analysed in around 1,000 subjects, with promising safety and immunogenicity data. It is currently in Phase III clinical trials with 26,000 participants in the country.  Ocugen have ‘expert’ regulatory capabilities in the US, meaning they know how to deal with the FDA. In preparation for the development of Covaxin for the US market, Ocugen has already assembled a Vaccine Scientific Advisory Board (VSAB) featuring leading academic and industry experts to evaluate the clinical and regulatory path for approval in the US market.  Wider market trends:  The new covid mutation has most likely already entered the USA. No doubt, there will be efforts to ramp up vaccinations to respond to this.  The vaccine will most likely take the form of a yearly vaccination like the flu shot. Even if Ocugen is late to the US, demand for the vaccine will not dwindle over the coming years.  Bharat Biotech is developing Covaxin with the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and has sought emergency-use authorization from the Indian drug regulator. We will get to see it’s efficacy in action before heading to the US.  I bought todays dip and was thinking to pull back. I snapped out of it and realised the only thing i’m pulling back is my cheesy foreskin for your mom 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
10368,"No.  The sell wall is just longs.  But if you can see how big it is, you might have a sense that $22 is a cap, for now, at least.  I think that big midday volume spike could likely have been short covering and noticing that they weren't going to need to go substantially above $22.  I kept telling people the infinity squeeze thesis was bunk because it presumes none of these 130m long shares have exit points at sane prices.  And they clearly do.  I pointed out that a *lot* of these shares are with investors that probably have exits at between $22 and $24, because a fundamentals based valuation would put you in that range mid next year.  In order for it to squeeze past that point, there still needs to be significant short interest after any shares sold at those exits get absorbed.  For this situation to change, you would need new longs coming in at, say $20, with substantial interest, and an exit well above $24.  I don't know how likely that is.  It seems pretty unlikely.  I mean, the vast majority of big investors still see GME as a dead company a few years out."

10371,iborrowdesk gets the data from IBKR API.  Today GME isn't in the[ list of shortable stocks](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?key=GME&amp;cntry=usa&amp;tag=United+States&amp;ib_entity=&amp;ln=&amp;asset=&amp;f=4587)  That's why it's not on iborrowdesk today.  On the IBKR app it appears as 'maybe shortable' with a borrow fee of 21.96%  That probably means the supply of shortable shares is running low.

That said, this is a high-risk play so you should be prepared to lose 25-30% of what you bet in the next few trading days.

10446,"Extremely slimy. I held thousands of SPCE shares until I watched an interviewer question Chamath about liquidating nearly 40% of his position. He claimed it was to “manage liquidity,” but his eyes darting around the room, body language, and apathetic statement about how he was committed to business were terrible."
10447,"What is the best place to get Citron news fast?  Regardless of the fact I can't stand what that company has done this year to shit on my positions, they have influence I'd like to hear about quickly and not after the rug has been pulled out from under me."

10451,"It has to, that’s the exact price this guy picked."
10452,But you are getting peenies for it cuz stonks only go up lol
10453,"It's a factor, but it's not a factor that moves the price of the stock up 35% in just 2 days. You're severely overestimating our influence if you think I'm wrong, because every WSB rich retard that buys 10k or 50k or even 100k GME shares pales in comparison to Cohen-type investor who casually adds one million+ stocks to his portfolio over the course of just 1 week.  And trust me, Cohen, Bury and co. are not the only whales invested in GME right now, there are dozens and, as much as I have a natural disdain for rich pigs who manipulate the market to their whims, they're on our side, for now at least..."
10454,"Arrrgh lost so much on LMND, hurts"
10455,It makes me lol that they’re called Melvin.

10459,to see daily updates on what options are being held (different from volume)
10460,probably didn't have a ton of additions to calls/puts open interest to make the top list
10461,Cramer basically did the same thing and made a ton his first time.
10462,"Buy GME in cash accounts only. Such as retirement accounts. When in cash account, shares can not be automatically made available to short sellers   To reduce availability of shares for shorts, you must buy in cash accounts, this will effectively remove your holdings from shares that can be made available fir shorts.   As a result , interest rates should start to go up. This will indicate there is a shortage of shares available on margin accounts for shorting  EDIT: I did my part. 20% of my retirement is in GME"
10463,I forgot all about the fair value being in the 20's.  That makes a lot more sense.  Definitely was over thinking this.
10464,What program or brokerage do you use to be able to see that kind of data stream?
10465,"I’m half in mmed and half in gme. I think mmed will go to at least $8-10 on uplisting, maybe a lot more depending on publicity at the time. Can you move some into gme or are you down a lot from the recent mmed drop?"
10466,So much FOMO
10467,It doesnt have to be the new world order it can be any greedy fuck in power trying to manipulate the market into his pocket. So here you are looking dumb on a page full of tards
10468,I think they can just pay a fine. Next pump is Cohen news or good numbers in early Jan.
10469,"Until they don't, then you end up with 100 shares and you can sell calls against them until that hits, then you go back to selling puts. #thewheel"

The company has over 49,578 employees worldwide and achieved US $19.299 billion in revenue during the 2018 fiscal year.”"

10472,"But don't they have billions at their disposal? I'm mega bullish, just saying"
10473,I’m bullish and I think I’m going to throw 10K at options as I can take a loss this year for tax purposes lol...

10475,Slicker defense play; FLR.  They have growing contracts for SCIFs near me; they have contractors with clearances worth like 75k a piece working on  infrastructure and shit..
10476,"Man you are next level ""touched"""
10477,"Okay but when you sell it you got the premium, then the stock goes down in price, but you sold that contact, so you are not gaining anything, then you get assigned, spend 3k for 100 shares when it should be 2.9k, then you sell calls, how long till you make the 100 difference... Good for you if you made a killing, but I don't think it's worth it"
10478,A year?! Da fux? I want it for next week Bb!
10479,"I won't be selling it till December most likely. The stock will run way above $150. Smarter to get long dated calls now before the premiums, and the word of mouth spread about ARK etfs."
10480,IDK Barron's also listed TSLA as overvalued but Dr. PP clearly put a $1200 price target on it yesterday. Something is fishy here.

10483,always buy. put if you think it will go down. call if you think up. don't wait for it to expire before you sell it. have an exit plan ready
10484,I would suck farts out of her ass like a bong hit!🚀🚀🚀🚀🌗🌗🌗🌗
10485,Looks fine but I think OP should taste it.  Gotta keep an eye on that diabetes.
10486,I say my favorite GILF and all my friends know who I’m talking about
10487,"I love how everyone on here is pretty silent about GME when it's in the mid $12s, and then there's no end of comments about buying more shares when it's well over $20.  SMH.  I mean, I could be totally wrong in selling a chunk, but I'm just going by what I see watching trades."
10488,"But his mental health is pretty concerning, right? Like he doesn't need to see a urologist, but he probably should talk to some medical professional to get to the bottom of why he's posting his pee pics to an online stock trading forum."
10489,What is your approach to trade? My guess is 14d expiry with 0.4 delta. Are you going to let them expired or exit earlier?
10490,So keep buying GME shares?
10491,Truly a hero. 👍
10492,Same. I’m patiently waiting for the shorts to push it down a bit more so I can buy again.
10493,"Tomorrow i think only manipulation by gay bears, but theres a strong floor well above where the funds bought their shorts so either way they will be covering next week. If anything im looking to buy whatever dip happens tomorrow, hopefully some cheap april options for the 2nd catalyst, hostile takeover attempt in march."
10494,"I also have a small 100k position in ARKF, thinking about adding some leaps."
10495,"Options are a lot cheaper too. I have shares in AKRF and ARKG, thinking about doing LEAPS come Jan"
10496,"Many people here bought near $19, which was the 52-weeks high, and then saw the stock drop below $13 after the earnings report. Those who sold lost. Those who held won.   For high-volatility stocks like these it’s recommended enter with a strategy. A popular one is to only buy a third or a half of the amount you want to buy, and leave the rest for dips along the way. If it never dips you may miss out on some gains. But if it dips 25% you’re gonna be thankful.   TL;DR: buy the dip f"
10497,My general is 2-7 days to expiration.  I’ll exit depending on how close it is to being at risk
10498,It’ll be the day after the day after the day after Christmas
10499,"A lot of people check options data every day to look for unusual volume.  Also, it's generally accepted that options buyers are little more informed than stock buyers on average, so their positions should be taken more seriously.  Obviously this is less true every day since Robinhood came into being, and options have gained popularity with retail investors.  Still useful though.  Of course you have to take into consideration the noise you get from MMs adjusting their positions."
10500,is RH a cash account?
10501,"$42,069\*\*\*  &amp;#x200B;  the comma is your wiener size if you sell early"
10502,How are you so smart it’s not fair
10503,Shorts still haven't covered. Still time.
10504,I almost sold puts on fastly right before fastly ceo came out and admitted they wouldn't meet earnings guidance.   Glad I didn't.
10505,I believe aphria has one too - not that its done much good for my shares
10506,"Exactly this.  I am playing GME too but retards act as if they dance through rain drops.  Holding onto these options is like a meth head playing with gasoline.  And fuck y'all and your **shares**.  This is WSB, gtfo with that pussy shit."
10507,Let’s see your proof of selling an April call on GME lmao
10508,The world ends and Jesus comes to save us all.
10509,"PLTR: No brainer (bought sub-$10)  PSTH: No brainer  TSLA: Will hold until I die (or Musk does)  AAPL: New revenue stream on accessories, new macs, own chip, etc  GFX: SPAC focused on tech./fintech. There be unicorns everywhere!"
10510,How about the upside? Do you let it expired or exit when it hit some level?
10511,"I bought 1,000 shares of FEYE when it dropped to $13.46...sold it at $16.80...now I feel like a complete dumbass watching it fly to $24!!!"

10513,yea bro go ahead and give that a try. let me know how it works out
10514,Exactly. Where is that guy now

10517,Clarity and color are two separate characteristics.
10518,Because it’s not.
10519,"Google SHO rule 203, but i'm not sure 203(b)(3) reads to me like it would come into effect if a certain broker failed to deliver an individual position  over 13 consecutive days. Not for the whole security if it shows up on the list with different positions."
10520,Should’ve left a giant shit on that.

10525,"Fuck you my guy, I’m selling all my trash equity and buying in anyways."
10526,"Check out codexis (CDXS). It’s one of arkg’s top holdings, but I like their code evolver technology. They sell licenses to the biggest pharma (including geneticists) for use of code evolver. When the pharma company develops a novel protein for a given treatment with code evolver, codexis also gets rights to the invented protein. In other words, codexis is charging the major developers in this space to do R&amp;D for them. If any breakthroughs are made by mrk, gsk, allergant, etc during this process, codexis could rocket. Also ARKG is buying up shares like mad"
10527,"but in this situation, if for example, you look at Apple and you have 199,545 open calls. How do you interpret that because doesn't that mean there are 195,545 ppl who bought calls and 195,545 ppl who sold calls? So its an even number of bullish and bearish."
10528,PACB is up 700% in the last 4 months but TAK seems like a good time to buy
10529,"So how do you interpret this? For example, are you concluding bullish or bearish open interest on Apple? Becuase if you look at Apple, you have 199,545 open calls. Doesn't that mean there are 195,545 ppl who bought calls and 195,545 ppl who sold calls for the contract to go through? So its an even number of bullish and bearish."

10531,"Folks here aren't happy unless they're trying to buy the top.  I mean, I've been guilty of fomo-ing, but the absolute insistence to buy at the top is wild."
10532,"Pole here. Tbh CDPR is a mistery. I sold my shares at 460 zł* (462,40 was highest right before 10 dec) and watched it go deep down. It went -40% yet many people in poland say it's still overvalued. Some say it's gonna jump back, and some say it'll dive to 200 zł.   *1 USD=3,7 zł."
10533,Isn’t this mostly because IV shot up recently?
10534,Most of my money is made from COSTCO and that is not a meme stock. I did serious DD on that and predicted the $10 special dividend on the dot.
10535,X gon give it to ya
10536,"Got it, thanks for sharing! I've tried playing iron condor in the past, might try again. One last question, with IC, you want a stable price, what are your fav stocks/etfs to do IC?"
10537,Then why the fuck isn’t Amazon going up. It’s like everyone wants this
10538,"Yeah I made good amount and secured half and then lost some riding it for another week. I'm out of COST for now but I'm keeping tabs on it. It's still a great stock, there are just better opportunities right now."
10539,"If you applied for margin, it is a margin account. If everyone buys in their cash accounts and avoid buying in margin accounts, borrowing rates will spike real fast. It will be more and more expensive to add new shorts. Eventually, this could help shorts capitulate"
10540,"imo a lower put/call ratio is bullish in general,  people who sell call options are not necessarily bearish (can people who buy puts are not necessarily bearish either, they might be hedging or something else)"
10541,Should be flaired as DD
10542,"Good timing dude, But I think it is time to get back in. CDPR has a talented team obviously and having played a lot of games of this type, CP77 is kind of best of both world between a RPG and a more action oriented GTA. Strong story, strong characters, it has the makings of a blockbuster and a good franchise. I assume they can fix these bugs and rebound"
10543,Lol my wife works at this Citron...or shitron as the employees call it.
10544,"So I agree with most of this post and hold puts, but a lot of the insider selling was likely triggered by the rapid rise in the stock price triggering automatic sells for exec stocks. Have to be careful about that."
10545,Wasn’t ITM when I bought it
10546,"I've posted this in some [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j42447/what_the_fuck_is_going_on_with_gme/g7gzf2x/) GME threads, but I don't think the list means much.

10547,No it’s up bc the underlying holdings have been jumping all week.
10548,Dd?
10549,"Us market time is 3:30am-10am in nz, but the next calander day. So the trading we see in NZ on Xmas is from the 24th in the states."
10550,Has the survey happened again recently? I’m sure more have added since I took it
10551,I didn't post it.
10552,I bought 40 shares at $33 😫  Luckily my 2000 shares at $25 make up for it 🚀🚀🚀🚀
10553,"Curious how put options cause a sell off, I somewhat understand how an influx of call options can cause a stock to go up in price but don’t really understand the reverse."
10554,"For those who are curious about actually figuring it out, looks like IV30 doubled after 12/3 putting ARKG's IV into the 96th percentile."
10555,"Thx man. Tbh that was my first ever trade and I was scared to invest money, so didn't make much. Btw fuck boomers who told me not to invest more coz ""priced in"". If I had my current knowledge of investing back then, I'd just yolo my whole savings. If I had discovered wsb in the beginning, I would have tripled my money yoloing pltr. Shame.  Right now I'm looking forward to yolo into pltr-ish stock before it explodes.  And as far as I have pretty big game industry knowledge, I have no fucking idea if CDPR is gonna recover soon. Not worth the risk if you ask me."
10556,So literally this https://youtu.be/-y0kQZX8xjY
10557,"It's because people here are retarded and have no idea how to research anything. They just look for rocket emojis, YOLO, and then cry it's someone else's fault they have no more money."
10558,"TBH I was shit scared and sitting on cash, but it's true what they say, scared money don't make money."
10559,"Depending on your time horizon, check Foley Tramisene II spac and paysafe. I don’t think that it is priced in at all. That’s a profitable company coming back on market in a big growth environment and of course anything related to payments is hot. They target Q1Q2 for the merger so you need a bit of patience but this one will be red hot. I work in the online gaming industry and Paysafe products represent a good 10% of gaming transactions in Europe. Strong brand recognition product and the market being fragmented per state in US, i think that the payment company is the best play in that sector. I will do a full DD post on it in coming days"
10560,It will be $30 very very soon. I hold the stock and its being a little trickster this month. This options game explains the reason for the price action.   I hope PLTR's December demonic possession is resolved. The exorcism of put positions and scarcity of shares to borrow will help us moon.
10561,PLTR SBE FEYE DIS UBER
10562,PLTR- autist pick  BB - Canadian in me BFT -  SSPK - weed maps is huge  FDX - huge drop recently
10563,"As I am a full retard and have no idea when will bullish market end, I want to ride the wave and double or triple money in 2021/Q1. You think it's possible? Would yolo into pltr because it's not going down anytime soon, but a year or two is too long. Maybe when the wave ends I'll go into long term stocks or etfs."
10564,"0% of analysts say to sell, and it just spiked a ton but why? Thanks for this"
10565,I love PLTR but I have a long term horizon for it. Being their own niche and working with governments and militaries will be super lucrative. I am sure they will announce steady new contracts in 2021 but will it me enough to make the stock skyrocket already? Not sure. But long term I am super bullish for sure. Someone mentioned that no new deals will be announced over the holidays (makes sense) so maybe you can buy in slightly cheaper early Jan and hope for big announcements in Feb
10566,"Lol, best post in a month. Did you use your right hand or your left?   I would have dropped my phone in there. Curse you Citron!!!"
10567,"Dude wtf, don't buy FD on this shit, please."
10568,"I do not buy shares- I hate having random amount of buying power left over.   I allocate 3 stocks per day- and put anything from 1k to 2k max in each stock. This way- even if 2 do bad, hopefully I get lucky with 1 and that is enough to upset some loses in bad days.   Usually tho- it’s 1 stock carrying, while the other 2 lag behind and sometimes just bring the whole thing down.   Essentially pick 3, put equal amount of around 1-2k and wait until next day. When I do this stredgy- I very seldom wait more 1 day to buy out (only don’t sell the same day cause of the day trading restriction)"
10569,Omg the mad lad actually did it. Look at ticker X it's so cheap get in before this thing goes to $420.69

10574,Gonna power over 1.1 million homes in Cali   And they’re looking to expand   Good chance they expand their big battery production for other cities in a Biden administration

10576,Isn’t the ceo on CNBC tomorrow?
10577,if being an idiot equates to my nw ill take it. call me dumbass bb
10578,"Wait, he bought puts &amp; calls at the same time?"
10579,Wow fuck just realized i called $GME gamespot and not GameStop like a retard. Anyhoo. I gonna trade in those 20 shares for some OTM calls at opening for the squeeze. Merry Christmas
10580,this is always the excuse they use. that they don't control when they sell etc etc. i think it's mostly bs as this always just happens to be when the stock is at an ath or before some bad news is announced
10581,I bought at .30 and got tired of it not moving. Sold at .32 last week. 📄👏
10582,A dollar is a dollar
10583,"It is not mostly BS. It is occasionally BS, but I can tell you as someone who deals with this on the daily most legit execs set their sell thresholds and whether they execute or not is based solely on the share price."
10584,Console supply is tight.  They can’t sell what doesn’t exist. Some will hit next quarter.
10585,I’m balls deep on $30 calls but I’m mentally preparing myself for a $29 pin. 99% chance it gets pinned.
10586,"New here. So, what happens to your 150 2021 DEC call if the stock’s at 200? Do you get to exercise for $50 profit per 100 shares? Do you have to buy all 100 shares of a call?"
10587,Dropped pltr just now like a hot pocket
10588,"You missed, now I'm confused, do I buy puts"
10589,How do you look at historical volatility on a symbol or contract?  ThinkOrSwim have that somewhere?
10590,"Someone has to sell at those sane prices though.  That's the entire point if the squeeze and the constant comparison to available float.  The existing short interest is already much higher than available float.    Yeah, millions of the shorts can get out reasonably, but they'll just sit on the stock same as the rest if us retards, trying to recoup losses.  No one is coming in to bail out the final bagholders who get margin called to oblivion."
10591,"Think of it as a very expensive lotto scratcher. Prob won't win anything, but there's always a chance"
10592,"I use marketchamleon, barcharts also has something similar"
10593,"Long-termer here - YES! to what you said. This story has now slowly leaked out to a broader, more wrinkly-brained (ahem) audience. This is the way."
10594,fair enough but still seems odd that execs would sell so much if they truly believe in the long term prospects of their company
10595,"Yup.  We'll see.  Not saying I'm sure at how this is gonna play out, but it certainly feels to me like the shorts can play a waiting game here for a bit.  Maybe we go range bound for a bit between $21 and $22.  I don't know.  I just figured that it might take some time to get to $24.  In the meantime, I can wait for it to pull back or put the money elsewhere."
10596,cause they're all pussies. when it starts going down they'll say sell but they're all afraid to be the first to stick their neck out
10597,Anyone care to translate this info about the SHO list? My brain is tawded.  [https://www.securitieslawyer101.com/2020/short-seller-regulation-sho/](https://www.securitieslawyer101.com/2020/short-seller-regulation-sho/)
10598,"When a market maker sells a put, they now have positive delta.  In order to get delta neutral, they have to short shares - and if they short enough of them, the share price goes down.  And to further add fuel to the fire, the more the price goes down, the more their delta increases, which means the more they have to sell"
10599,Great DD. I will be buying puts.  I was astounded at the stock price rise. I truly believe this stock will be going down.  Just not a believer in monthly style boxes...
10600,"New here, so what's the deal... Sell after the squeeze or 💎 hands forever?"
10601,You could’ve scalped it and made more than double
10602,ARKG is starting to get that serious high quality meme status. I think a lot of people are gonna be getting into this long term. I just bought 100 shares on margin and I’m up 22% in a few weeks. I also have some margin in the other ARK funds. This is like the easiest low effort money you can make.
10603,I still don’t know why anyone touches gme... I mean you can explain your position to me but I won’t understand...
10604,"It’s actually a great way to play into a dip that you’re not sure when will happen. You know you want to profit on the fall and buy the dip to then profit on the recovery as well so you just sell cash-secured puts to generate revenue in the meantime at a strike you think will be close to the bottom until the dip happens, then simply allow yourself to be assigned and ride those shares back up. You could even sell covered calls to replicate the revenue stream you had before.  I think you are confused between some kind of very risky naked call/put selling strategy and something where you have the cash to exercise or be assigned comfortably. The play outlined above does not have that kind of dramatic loss potential you describe unless you just get an outlandishly steep decline in the underlying but even then, you’re not leveraged so your losses are limited to the percentage decline in the underlying."
10605,So the short squeeze is going to start on Monday guaranteed?
10606,"I hadn’t heard of this, but I was researching most active calls https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pltr/option-most-active  Crazy call volume $28 and above Dec 24 and Dec 31.  This will be manipulated south of $28 until the new year.  Not stopping me from going long, but people need to be patient for about another 2 weeks."
10607,"So buy $20c 12/31 on the dip tomorrow, sell them on Monday or Tuesday and buy april calls with the money?"
10608,Are you me?
10609,We can see you have a baby dick in the reflection
10610,It's actually good for you. And tasty too
10611,Only those with 13 fail to deliver days will have to close on Monday. They will probably throw a hail mary tomorrow as a last shot to suppress the stock. Buy that dip if that happens
10612,Bought when it was $0.60. Dropped and stayed at $0.30 forever. Sold for 50% lost a month ago. Fucking timing.
10613,Technically their “cash accounts” are margin accounts which is why they still have that PDT BS. So no
10614,"These are shares so I won't lose money through decay unlike options. Ryan Cohen, who is a major shareholder, bought more at $16 per share so that's the floor. The downside is capped and upside is open ended."
10615,Get on it soon. I think it will be going to slowly rocket for the next few months
10616,All the defense companies are undervalued
10617,i don't have margins on
10618,"&gt; ARKG is starting to get that serious high quality meme status  Meme status in the sense of hype, maybe, but not valuation.They don't really let it stray too far from NAV in terms of price, they even have a daily chart towards to bottom on their fund page: https://ark-funds.com/arkg"

10626,I just don’t get the business model. A brick and mortar game store when all other retailers offers the same physical hardware and for the most part every game is online these days. I’m 31 and don’t have time to play more than a couple games a year or I fall behind but it just don’t see the future here. I read about the short squeeze here on Reddit but that’s above my head.
10627,Why the other two? link me to your dd please?
10628,"The NAV is just based on the market prices of the underlying stocks owned in the ETF. Those stocks are going up cause ARK is buying them. And ARK is buying them cause she keeps getting new clients plowing money into her ETF and she has to invest that money lol. In conclusion, a lot of this is liquidity driven and based on massive inflows of money into here funds - which is well deserved I guess given her track record and performance this year."

10635,Y’all need Jesus
10636,"I started frequenting this sub in Feb/March when we were all gay bears and laughing at ""the beer virus.""  I was first here for the laughs and memes.  I then realized that there is A LOT of information here.  Both great and awful.  You have to figure out for yourself what you want to follow and trust.  I've decided to throw ""fundamentals"" away because this market is 1000% fully retarded.  Things are trading on sentiment and hope.  You'll find some tickers constantly mentioned and a lot of that is based on survivorship bias (Bullish on: GME, PLTR, TSLA, the ARK etfs, CROX, CRSR, DKNG, NIO, LI, XPEV) (Bearish on: NKLA, DASH).    Pick something and do some research on it.  Compare and contrast what you find against WSB.  Right now, I'm 1000% full retard bullish on GME.  [Check out this GME stock vs. console cycle chart](https://thecollective.finance/2020/10/gamestop-gme-a-squeeze-to-44-from-14-can-be-justified-fundamentally-100-of-the-shares-are-short-watch-out/).  ""Past performance isn't an indicator of future performance"" but that's all anyone has to go on.  There's a very good argument to be made that GME will shoot up after Q4 2020 earnings (which is expected to be 3/24/2021) based on just the new console cycle.  Add that to the short interest (over 100%) you can understand why everyone is going crazy on GME.  Decide how much risk you want to take on.  Decide on your time frame.  Are you looking to find a lottery ticket in 1 week/1 month?  Or are you looking to make more modest but safer gains over a few months?  I lost almost 5k in the beginning because I didn't understand options (the greeks) and weeklies.  I don't do weeklies anymore - too much risk for me.  Now I only buy options OTM (but within 10-20%) at least 1 month out.  My gains won't be as insane as some of the screenshots you see here but I'm not going to lose 5,10,20k in 1 week.  All you need is for your account to keep going up, the speed isn't all that important.  Don't let 1 red day wipes out your entire account.    Currently I'm really invested and long on PLTR (mix of shares and calls for 1/2021, 3/2021).  Also long on weed stocks, the safest way to play weed is with the ""MJ"" etf.  Long on NIO because of their battery as a service (BaaS).  ""Long"" on GME of a few months; I'll sell and not look back after the short squeeze.    Some longer (later 2021 and 2022) safe investments would be stocks that have been beaten up by COVID.  Stuff like: AAL, UAL, PK, CNK, and other travel/hotel/retail stocks.  Again, this is all based on your time frame."
10637,"I took a sizeable chunk in LMT about a month ago, no real reason I took it over NOC other than I think it will have a slightly larger pullup. I'm pretty pleased with the recent acquisition though, nice move to challenge rayth and noc.  Figure it's just going to sleep a few months until covid disappears and everyone goes back to being scared of other people."
10638,my understanding is when calls are added to open interest that means someone bought the calls from someone else who sold the calls and hence there is a contract although this contract is open because it hasn't been closed or executed. Am I missing something?
10639,"Where are you pulling the number of those long positions from? Outstanding shares are at less than 70 million. Are you counting the shares that GameStop bought back, or is it same shares being sold twice by brokers, or something entirely else?"
10640,Someone got a link?   Reddit search is worth nothing... where to invest into that?
10641,I bought shares in every single ARK fund this morning with my stimulus check that I haven’t received yet. Can’t go tits up.
10642,"sorry but this stock is shit. Cathie added this for Chamath and for heads up on his future IPO X mergers. OPEN is a shit app, with shit reviews, and Zillow etc are miles ahead of them.

10741,So buy the dip tomorrow is what your saying
10742,It's going to 100$ in 2 months
10743,"Quit everything, you found the glitch, you will be a millionaire"
10744,So are spac's allowed or not?
10745,Yea let me just get rid of my long PLTR shares and calls bc this guy thinks so
10746,"Geezus you're right. People just buy it.  Likely end of Q1. They are building out with this merger, and if you take pet comparisons like Chewy and Freshpet, yes Barkbox is different, but with the subscription base model, its silly, but still people will buy. I asked a couple people that have pets if they heard of it, and they said oh yeah!  So fuk it, I jumped in for 2k in my Roth for now. Likely will drop down to $12 in a month, then add more."
10747,"Personally have March 15c on TLRY, but I got comfortable with it a different way.  TLRY is a large provider of hemp to the US. Look into Delta-8 and how rapidly that's taking off due to the 2018 Farm Bill. Combined with APHA, they cover the delta-8 and delta-9 markets and APHA has a marketing genius at the helm."
10748,Can't even find this company on Google.   &amp;#x200B;  Sticking with GME and deepFuckingValue
10749,"He calls his robinhood account his ""broker."" This guy doesn't fuck."
10750,EXACTLY. All PLTR has shown me that it goes up.
10751,"biden is a living corpse. he will be a president that signs what's in front of him. He will do noting to impede the progressives in his party as he knows this is the future...other than being black and a woman, its the third reason why kamala was picked. Should the senate and the house vote on it with dem majorities in seats....it will pass. I have the same beliefs as you but I dont see both georgia seats going dem. Regardless, it isnt impossible that a senator or two break with party on this issue. Kamala is very pro legalization .PS. tlry is currently under investigation."
10752,"I agree. Lawsuit doesn’t mean shit though, firms “investigate” companies all the time and they still gain"
10753,I have it on DKB
10754,Someone got me on this stock and I got some 25c for 1/15 and they’re cooking 🚀
10755,"I'm confused, it only says buy."
10756,"Had 5k sitting around that i was looking to throw at something i did 0 research on. Scrolled through my favorite ""investment"" reddit and found this post. Was short enough to not be algobotbitchass DD and was long enough to be from somebody with above 90 IQ. Im in. Lets get that bread!"
10757,"All In for 1,250 shares"
10758,Is it  $Stic or $Stic= or $Stic.u   Getting all of these
10759,electrification has no long term future.

10766,"Weed doesn't have to be legalized at the federal level to be profitable; it just needs to be decriminalized.  After that, individual states may work out how they wish to establish legalization and regulation.  Better that way all around actually, and the citizens of those states which choose not to legalize and regulate cannabis will become tourists to other states, thus promoting interstate trade and positively affecting other industries in the entertainment and hospitality sectors.  Win-win.  Now, if America could export locally-grown weed legally to other countries - that would get very interesting..."

10775,"Godspeed and I hope you make tendies, but I'm not gonna follow. I do think its likely GME will dip back down to 17-19, but I would beat myself every day if I sold now only for it to squeeze. I'd rather ride the dip back up than risk missing a possible squeeze. Good luck man!"
10776,A better play would be buying airlines or cruise companies. They'll be more effected by that news than jnj will.
10777,"If it is from /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT, then yes. Mods would not dare."
10778,"If they all go down, and take years to get back to normal price, how has the market risen at all, ever? Every year they wouldnt have made it back to normal under your idea, and would plunge further."
10779,"no, they all go to 0 every xmas eve, and take years to get back to anything, and then 4 years later there is another xmas eve and it does it again."

10787,I wouldn't be bullish on gme now but who tf mentioned that puts on bottom right? :D
10788,What about CURLF?.   Curaleaf is building a 'research facility' in my city. The mayor approved the permits and is proud about it.
10789,So uh.. What was you exit on GME?
10790,You missed the most important part - she was also the top executive at Hearst - the biggest publishing company and she works at her desk like [this](https://twitter.com/JoannaColes/status/1026553562640175104) and talks about her children like it's *us*  https://twitter.com/JoannaColes/status/1026553562640175104

10793,"Their hits have a short term effect, so following them in the short term is fine. Most of the time they just like to hit on whatever sort of pops and post right before a correction which would've happened anyway but they are an easy catalyst."

10796,Much safer. Options are lottery tickets
10797,"Fuck it, 10 shares for me"
10798,Law firms like that do this with every SPAC or any company that takes a major dip. Trying to make money on lawyer fees similar to highway car crash ambulance chasing lawyers. Usually those suits never go anywhere

10809,"I never buy calls on an up day.  Mainly because you are buying options with a hefty premium that is already priced in...  If you bought $20 calls when GME was $12, and now that GME is over $21, THAT would have been real money maker... but who could have known?  Genius, autist... fortune teller...  odds would have been enormously against the buyer buying $20 call FDs..."

10812,Get out by 4:50??  &amp;#x200B;  Inverse this man.
10813,Why have a bunch of meme stocks when you can invest in dog toys.      I'm in.
10814,I’m into analyzing elections and while it is possible that Democrats take both seats it’s highly unlikely. Perdue needs 0.3% addition from his Election Day total. 2.3% of voters cast their votes for Libertarian candidate. Ossoff would need 2.1% increase from a vote that skews right.
10815,"Nope, you're fine - it's not there. I'm relatively new to 212, but I know that they don't add SPACs as soon as they show up. Hopefully this time it will be different.  edit - there is request to add it on their forums from 5 days ago, so fingers crossed."

10820,Self fulfilling prophecy?      ***INVERSE IT.***
10821,Unrealized gains can go away just as fast.
10822,u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT IS it worth buying warrants at this price if I only have a couple hundred to throw at it? Or should I just buy stock. I'm new at this and bought my first options a couple days ago
10823,Can't find this on wealthsimple :(
10824,"I was going to pass, but f-it, im in"
10825,What’s it names under Robinhood homie!

10867,when you buying? shit is really high right now for a spac
10868,"my knowledge stops there tbh. From what I know, SPACs used to be a fairly untraditional way to IPO, and generally a ""back-up"" when traditional IPO route wasn't feasible or well received after a road-show. But they certainly have blown up in 2020 and i'm not sure why"
10869,"You can do even better than that, look at the stocks your obesssed with that have been year sin businesses' and look at their charts.  Additionally on bing/google you can sort by date during the last many christmas' across years and see reports about Xmas eve or day before stock crash and it going all the way for some time.  Unless you grabbed the right stock that randomly shot up every year, you'll see most of your stocks crashed most Christmas eve's or around that, if not all of them.  Also come back here tomorrow."
10870,I’m bullish on gme but where are you seeing that at? The place I looked has a book value around $5/share.
10871,It's short of SPACeship.
10872,This was a shitpost??? I invested actual money on this!
10873,"That actually not what the post says, Xmas eve is the big start of the crash and it will likely keep crashing or stagnate after.  Alsl lol second week of jan, see you tomorrow."

10905,"Piggyback for visibility. Encourage you all to go read up on energy as a service. What are they looking at? Mostly hot water heaters. This company isn’t going to get into the electric vehicle sector… So basically energy as a service is essentially leasing electric hot water heaters to consumers, and the service company would get a flat rate, and drive profit by heating the water when energy prices are lowthroughout the day."

10907,You’re such an idiot. You will cause many people to sell GME now. Why would you do that?
10908,"Big name on the most important financial institution out there (WSB), I'd guess that it did."
10909,And I thought you said you were in GME until April? You just proved you’re a liar.
10910,That flashing F is surprisingly suitable.
10911,I'd say 700-800k. Within a month. Absolute retardation.
10912,"@SIR_JACK_A_LOT Seems that units are still available (STIC/U $16.25). Did they just separate? and how many warrants (STIC/WS, $4.90) per unit?  Guessing based on price of STIC ($14.83) less than 1W:2S?"
10913,"Well that was easy, lemme try this. 🤔 Now buy me 100 shares sir."
10914,"Autist buys 1 put at $15 for 0.55  Stonk is at $15, then goes to $12  Now, the option is exercised by autist, so Institution has to  buy at $15, but has to sell at the market price  ($12).  $-300 loss on the 100 stonks going down + $55 in premiums = $245 loss for the Institution  Or it could be even worse: stonks could go down to  $9 or even $3  = bigger losses  So when the Institution sells the put to the autist, they short the stock as well, meaning that when it goes down to $12, the Institution gets $300 from shorting the stocks.  Shorting profit $300 + $-300 loss (from buying at $15 and selling at 12$) + $55 = $55 profit  But this doesn't take into account the cost of shorting (which would mean the Institution would actually receive less then the full $55)  If stocks go up, it goes tits up for the Institution as well.  So if you buy enough puts, Institutions have go out and short 100x the number of shares (because 1 put controls 100 shares), meaning the stock goes down, because there are now way more sellers then buyers because of the Institutions selling (shorting) so much stock.  This is like the most basic smooth brained explanation possible (because I'm retarded), so actually try and do some research on this before you start trying to start infinite short squeezes on Robinhood infinite margin...  Hope this helps u/telperiontree"
10915,Everything here is a shit post
10916,Just read ALL IN STIC and moved all my money
10917,"Right, I know I can't. I was just trying to make it clear how new I am lol.  Is it worth buying warrants on this? I don't really know what they do but I know they increase profit potential"
10918,Will STIC a few bucks in it.

Then she starts gettin all hype the week it’s supposed to come and don’t even get me started on when she actually opens it.    Bonus DD: BARK actually makes quality toys.  We have a Jack Russell who fucks EVERY SINGLE toy up and chews it to literal pieces until he’s shitting it out for the next couple days, but she upgraded and now they’re damn near indestructible.

10920,I went in just now to stick.ws
10921,Do you put a bulk order when you want to buy a large number of shares (when you go all in) or do you keep doing that over time trying to buy the dips ?   Holding SPIC 550 shares
10922,You had me at SIR_JACK_A_LOT.  I need SIR_JACK_A_LOT alerts on my phone. Wish I saw this three hours ago when it was posted.

10931,Let’s get it
10932,You sold CHWY SHARES for a loss?
10933,Lmao right you see that fucking shit!
10934,I like weedmaps more than all of them tbh
10935,I had paper hands &amp; sold before it took off...
10936,I think there are other SPACS that could do much better i.e. anything EV related.  But you'd be pretty safe putting money in this at $12-13. The floor is $10 after all. At least until after the merger.
10937,"GME almost went to +50% in a week, stick with it if you want but might as well add another 50% here"

10940,"Didn't get in before close, gonna miss the rocket"
10941,I bought shortly after IPO and sold pre Rona. There was a good 9 month period where the stock was doing dick all and I got tired of waiting. Hindsight 20/20 didn’t know big rona would give me a 4-5 bagger

10947,Everytime I try to on RH it just puts it on hold till market open.
10948,Looks like you dont like making money. You missed 10% just because you thought the share price was a bit higher. I cant stop loving this sub to see people like you. You are like one of those who didnt buy tesla last year at $300 because you wanted to enter in at $299

10951,I just bought in fuck it.
10952,\*Hulk Hogan Voice\*  &amp;#x200B;  HELL YEA BROTHER!
10953,So i did the math for you. At the moment of writing this there is like 300k worth of stocks from this post assuming everybody that commented bought @ $14. This doesn’t include the master /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT and all the other autist that said they are all in in the comments.   Also they send a dog to space once but 2021 it is going to the moon..
10954,Omg! I bought tesla when it was at $1. Beat THAT!
10955,Degiro and trading212 don't have STIC 🥺
10956,Did you? Fucking hell you’ve had a rip well played. Top trader what year did you start your fund?
10957,It's faster and doesn't leave as much $$ on the table as a traditional IPO
10958,"This is definitely not insider trading, all info gathered was public knowledge. Now stock manipulation...?"

10967,"Set up an account at interactive brokers. Yes there are some fees (unless you use IBKR lite) but they are really tame. The largest drawback are the minimum order sizes, usually only lots of 100 can be traded. But they are way, way better.

10988,"I like cheap companies right when they IPO, the issue with OpenDoor is that they are halfway between WeWork and Zillow. They are exposed to real estate prices and they need huge capital investments to make their business model work. If we see a spike in unpaid rent / mortgage defaults when the stimulus checks and the eviction moratorium end next year, OPEN could be stuck holding the bag.      Would be really good to pickup this stock after a housing market drop though, they can make a ton of money flipping these properties."

11015,"I had to look them up and they look decent. Not great but despite having all my savings in trading212 I wouldn't even rate them as great at all :D  Tastyworks seems to have comissions and that's actually a plus in my opinion! Whenever something is free* there's always that asterisk to look out for. They have to make money somehow and not relying on zero commission as a hook to draw in customers tends to be something good brokers do.  I'm still favoring IBKR but that's at least in part due to their API. Tastyworks is pretty clearly focussed on smaller customers so there's that. Their commissions are compared to IBKR on their page but it's a bit sketchy, seems to be very specifically chosen for their benefit. But it's nice to know that I'd pay 600$ less when opening contracts with a volume of 1 million USD or more.  If you try them I'd like to read about your experience with them!"

11034,bruh how do you even know that there will be another pandemic in 2025? Insider info?
11035,Are you just buying the stock or can you buy calls on this?  Also if you’re predicting massive appreciation in STIC over the course of 2021 then when are you planning on buying back into GME? Are you just going to hold STIC until the first big correction or do you expect GME to continue to appreciate in 2022 and 2023?
11036,Seems like a great analysis. Didn't read it though. ALL IN. YOLO.
11037,"From the little I've seen, I feel like this is one of the few early SPAC that has a great background. My issue is the expected net revenue growth.   Valuations performed by either the target company or typically the PE firm makes the first forecast year's revenue substantial, or in this case, 65% increase from the prior year's sales amount. Afterwards, revenue growth is pared. This makes EBITDA margins look more attractive since they're typically viewed on a Next-Twelve-Month (NTM) basis.   Basically, 65% growth is probably not what they're actually going to make in 2021 and while they may grow close to that amount, it can be seen as an aggressive number. Auditors have checked and reviewed the valuation amount but they're just there to check off the necessary boxes and the amount of BS answers I've heard justifying these growth % are typically superficial at best.  What makes this worrying is that they made one of the slides on their investor deck dedicated to only the NTM number and margins, and they're not even using EBITDA which is an important number when it comes to M&amp;A and transactions in general. If there's strong expected growth, you would absolutely see a further years projected. This may be an oversight, however.  That being said, I am FOMOing in."

11050,annnnnnnd it's at 16 AH......
11051,"No, it literally cant go tits up. doggy style"
11052,"It's hilarious seeing DD with tons of upvotes then going to check the ticker and seeing the AH boost. You retards are actually insane and I love it!  What's even better? I've seen a couple DDs on this in the past couple weeks, but when this madlad posts it, you degenerates throw your money at it like monkeys throwing their shit.  In for 500 shares."
11053,You can message them it takes 1-2 weeks. Yes it sucks.
11054,"Welcome retard! 50% of the time, it works every time"
11055,Amazon didn’t turn a profit until like a few years ago
11056,"My gf is a vet and she has shares in CHWY and this, what more do you need to know?"
11057,What’s the PT? Need to know if it’s worth buying at open tomorrow after you autists jacked the price AH
11058,Followed you in game and bought 3k of this. Still holding game and a bunch of MT. I dont know how much to put in this.
11059,everytime someone posts a schwab graph here its at least 6 figs and healthy.   What are you guys doing over there that everyone else isnt?
11060,Exactly same thing happened to me. now i refuse to get back on GME for my own pride. All in on STIC baby
11061,For anyone just finding out about this now. The ticker is $STIC and will trade under $BARK once the merger is completed (estimated Q1 or Q2). These guys are the real deal and Becky’s can’t stop throwing down their bf’s credit cards into this gimmick. $365M estimated revenue for 2021 and gaining market cap at over 2x the rate of Chewy’s early days. Load up at market open this train isn’t stopping until $25-$30/share.   TLDR; it’s NOT TOO LATE. In Jack a Lot we trust 🤝
11062,"That ISIN I posted is what I typed into ING (only searching in the watch list function, didn't buy yet)"

11070,I see DD with your name attached. Threw 1k in without reading. Getting the hang of this investing shit
11071,I bought those $20 Calls when it was $12 because deepfuckingvalue has that exact strike in every post he’s made monthly for over a year 😛
11072,lmfao i freed up half. Fuck it. Im not missing shit this autistic asshole posts anymore he has a knack for making money
11073,"Sorry bro, now you can pay high end escorts for their time and trades ideas"
11074,MMs don’t buy/sell 100 shares per contrac to hedge delta/gamma. Closer to 30 shares per contract on a .3 delta option.  And since MMs are selling both calls and puts they can balance their books with an even smaller ratio of shares.
11075,They don’t short 100 shares per contract. They only short whateve the delta is. And since they are selling calls too...they can balance their risk by not having to short or go long.
11076,Jonah lupton posted about this yesterday. And the dude is big in the stock world. So I expect this to baloon too
11077,Amazon lost money for over 20 years. If a company is taking profits and not reinvesting everything into growth early on then they are doing something wrong.
11078,"who gives a fuck, the plug paid."
11079,There’s a severe lack of options on this
11080,"Why would you like to see an income vs. putting that money to work? Not arguing, just curious on your viewpoint."

11082,I'm 500 shares deep but this is wrong info  This is carryover from OpenTable which used to have the ticker OPEN
11083,Are your taxes just absolutely fucked?  Based on your post history TurboTax doesn’t seem to be enough to figure your shit out.
11084,Same here. At first I thought this was a meme pump but the company seems legit. Good info on the CEO. Not too often these days that founders realize they aren't cut out to bring the company to the big leagues. Seem responsible.
11085,I’m new here. Thinking of taking $10k out of my efund HYSA cause $30k is too high and it just sits there. What you’re saying is put it all in STIC?!
11086,"It's kinda crazy  Melvin Capital's shorts are all up tmrw, meaning that they've lost the majority of their money and they still want to keep trying against us.  GME SHARES  🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀"
11087,"top 10 anime betrayals of all time :( in order to exit GME you had to sell, ugh"
11088,Yeah yeah you just mad you missed PLTR we get it
11089,But why? Why not just roll more money into the business instead of worrying about profits in a few years?
11090,I’m the opposite...except I don’t have calls.  Stock only.
11091,What is your balance up to after those dummy thicc GME days?  So absurd.
11092,Right? I bought 1 fucking share just to track it and it freaking jumps. If I bought 100 shit would of definitely gone the other way
11093,"Clearly you're not basic. However does the majority of US think like you? The job its fulfilling is that it makes dog owners feel good about doing something ""good"" for their pups. Not saying you're wrong - just actively thinking out loud"
11094,"bro profits are used to reinvest back into the company or pay dividends to shareholders. I’m not saying operating at a net loss is bad, because it all depends on their operating/investment/finance activities which differentiates among all companies."
11095,"I don’t think the idea has any staying power. Get a box of shit in the mail for a couple months... get tired of it and cancel.  I’d imagine they spend a lot on customer acquisition and barely break even after generating a lot of attention on social media.  When the hype dies down, they’ll die a slow (or fast) death.  They don’t offer any real value that is comparable to a business like chewy.  Just my opinion - dog owner who runs an internet business and shitposts on wsb"
11096,"stic.u is acquistion units, but I have no idea what those are.  I bought STIC and STIC.WS (warrants) for now.  We'll see if OP posts positions."
11097,"It's a good stonk if only people heard about it , no one knows wtf bark box is."
11098,man cnbc spent like 20 minutes with the CEO today talking about the fucking barkbox and she was totally into it...  fucking buy.
11099,I have purchased the subscription for a year when I first got my dog. Some people gift subscriptions too. My dog would get so excited about every package because she loved the stupid things. It was really cute and was a nice surprise every month. I got in during a deal and the price was very reasonable per box. Just because it isn’t your cup of tea doesn’t mean it isn’t Becky’s. Also they sell their toys at Target.
11100,I've been buying STIC.U from a twitter tip but also have no idea what they are
11101,Sir please change your ways this is a diamond pack
11102,Since when has a company had to make money for the stock to take off?
11103,Up 5% so far lol
11104,You’re up already AH 👍🏻
11105,Im too retarded to understand why we can't buy calls. Cause its too new still?
11106,It’s in a 401k so he doesn’t have to worry about taxes.... yet

11110,"Sooooo they’re under investigation by two major law firms for potential violations of fiduciary duty in regards to the reverse merger...  Is that standard, or reason to be concerned? First firm notified a few days ago, second released a statement a few hours ago"
11111,All in
11112,"Because politics motherfucker, pick up a polisci book or google search the topic numbnuts!  I actually got that wrong. Schumer becomes majority leader I believe but Harris will cast her vote to determine outcome. I’ll change that up"

11114,I mean this unironically  You're a retarded person   You know beyond any shred of a doubt that every single stock on earth in history has dips   So why panic when you see a dip
11115,Bought a shit load on this dip today.
11116,Only problem is he is the escort now and it ain't a Pretty Woman story.
11117,"Highly unlikely, are you fucking high?  Republicans are a decent favorite but not a runaway."

11119,yea that's why he didn't show a screenshot of his position this time
11120,"Sounds like you have an employer direct IRA. You need to set up a self directed IRA or Roth IRA. Under employer IRA they generally only offer certain options.  If you open your own Roth, you're using after-tax money also."
11121,You’re a fucking hero to this subreddit.   Thank you.
11122,Making a profit isn't the only way to reinvest. But I think I misunderstood you and thought you were implying this was a bad way to operate. Pretty sure we're saying the same thing. Hope we both make tendies tomorrow.

11128,"Selling my PGE shares , all in ."
11129,Also I saw some bark box ads on reddit and one of them was a meme so it can’t go tits up
11130,No it does not. This company is in growth mode. I’d rather a company spend money on marketing and SG&amp;A to capture a market and then turn on the profitability boosters later on to make money. Plus in this market growth is king. Look at ANY tech company that is &gt;5x revenue valuation
11131,I’ll be sure to tell you I told you so on January 6😉
11132,I'd pay to watch that
11133,We are the market movers now.
11134,dammit i was waiting for a possible dump to 13$ :(
11135,Biden was favored the majority of the time with the exception of Election Day.  I hope it works out I have a few calls on TLRY.  Just think if you are trying to capitalize on the weed industry a $PM would be a better bet.  They have the logistics all set up for mass production.
11136,Ah. Got it.
11137,"Can't trade options yet, anyone know when those start?"
11138,Is it too late to get on this tomorrow morning? I missed it today :(
11139,I was only concerned that I couldn’t buy more (after-hours complicated things). Sir jack has the golden touch.
11140,"They are ambulance chaser firm. They investigate every spac merger for fiduciary breaches. It’s a BS law firm chasing a BS investor suit. They are just digging through the dirt looking for dirt, which they won’t find, because Barkbox is legit.   Source re: ambulance chaser law firm: I’m a lawyer. Also, as an aside, I don’t offer this as legal advice and I am not creating an attorney client relationship with what I wrote here (gotta cover myself disclaimer wise, since I just indicated I’m a lawyer)."
11141,Maybe tomorrow! Wish I was still holding! Don’t get too greedy
11142,"Someone help me out here.  The merger will happen in Q2?  And we are expecting GME to explode anytime from now till Q1 results, so shouldn't we hold till Q1 at least then swap our positions into STIC pre-merger?  Or will STIC moon before GME?"

11145,I bought 5 shares. I don’t have a lot of cash in the game but my $80 is going to be worth $160!!!
11146,It becomes BARK and within 18 months is diluted by 50+%. It's good times.
11147,My parents usually get a box every month or two and I love reading through all the shit inside.  They have some really creative designers and you can tell that there's a ton of thought put into everything.
11148,"I definitely think you are onto something with the ancillary play (stocks that trade with cannabis but don't actually contain cannabis - these will fly high because big institutions CAN invest in them) of IIPR.   I like two other cannabis ancillary plays better and these two have not run up in share price as much as IIPR has already:  Grow Generation (GRWG) - retail hydroponics store leader  Hydrofarm (HYFM) - recent IPO and hydroponics equipment maker. GRWG sells their equipment in their own stores.   Agrify - (private company - possible 2021 IPO) smaller version of Hydrofarm.   And lastly, I really like Cronos (CRON) due to it's big tobacco backing in Altria (MO).   I think you can do well with the MSOS ETF. I don't think the same of Tilray/Aphria due to the lack of a big liquor or tobacco backer as they run the risk of burning thru all their cash and going BK."
11149,Ho lee fuk  This sounds so much like pets.com but it’s a SPAC bubble a bubblin’  In for 10k in shares and 5k in warrants in the AM
11150,Holy fuck in on a spac at 16$ are you crazy? This shits up 10% just in after hours
11151,Why now? The merger won’t take place until 2q21. Why tie up capital now for a catalyst that won’t come for months?
11152,Its bigger around than it is long but it feels great.
11153,I think its fair to say this year is not normal... so dont expect normal patterns

Unfortunately, I think the revenue projections rely on way too many assumptions about unproven new product growth and we're way too far from NAV for me to venture in at this point. Sales growth has declined for the last 3 years.  I hope they have as bright of a future as I would expect from a company with their track record, just a few too many red flags for me. Guaranteed to soar because you picked it though -D"
11157,Selling puts are actually bullish. You expect it to expire worthless.. they are making money if it goes over the strike.

11160,"Made money on GME, vaguely remember you posting, fuck it I'm in."
11161,Sure but that's not what we are talking about
11162,he just got a crazy pump just from posting here. he could basically just sell and we wouldn't know. he bought positions before posting. we literally just made him a good 140-160K profit

11164,PP didn't go up?
11165,"It's silly but I'm sub'd like a little bitch to a dom to Bark box. Excellent customer service in my opinion, and despite the issues of the USPS, they've been rather consistent on deliveries."

11167,looking forward to it
11168,Jumped to 16+ AH buy now wait for Becky’s and Karen’s to jump in over the next couple of weeks pushing the price to 25 30 then sell. Don’t forget everything is “priced in” these days sometimes years in advance 🙂

11176,"Ngl, you’re partly the reason I was/am in on GME. While I’m too much of a pussy bitch to completely YOLO on any one play, I sure as shit will be following you into this venture and your next and your next.    &amp;nbsp;    &amp;nbsp;   #YOU ARE MY KING 👑"

11178,"SPACs in general have been popping and drooping but you will most likely be able to find some pull back... there's always a risk you won't. if you have the opportunity to average in, you should."
11179,Seems like easy money lol.  This is a classic WSB pump and dump
11180,"Read some of the stuff Bill Gurley rights about them. Basically when you IPO and it jumps from the issue price of $68 to over $150 on the day of the IPO the investment banks and their clients have made 2x-3x for holding a stock a day. Whereas the founders, VCs, and employees who have worked years to get to this point are locked up for 6 months. And the company who is selling shares at $68 missed out on $82 ($150-$68) per share of cash going into the company. If they raised $100m in the IPO the company literally missed out $120m in extra cash selling the same number of shares because the bankers at goldman mispriced the IPO way too low so they and their clients could get a huge 1 day profit."
11181,Damn they're gonna print $$$ lol
11182,Lol here comes the pump and dump. Homeboy said he was staying in gme for 2x-10x. He isn't even up 1X

11190,"Not saying it won't go up, but you left out the fact that STIC will only own 12.6% of Barkbox after they combine, which makes it seem a lot less undervalued than your post does...

11208,Well explained.  I think [this is the Bill Gurley article](https://abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/) you were referencing.
11209,some people just want to see their money burn
11210,Do GME and post your positions so we can give you internet point
11211,"Exactly how I feel about this. This dude has enough clout here now that he just announces his big dick position, it pumps and then he can unload the bags onto the naive people here that follow him and hype it.  Volume and price shot way up not long  after this post too."
11212,He's just sharing his play so you guys can hype and pump his position untill he sneaks out and leaves everyone with the bags...  Kinda seems like you guys are just donating your money to the big dogs of the sub by doing this.
11213,Exactly. This dude has enough to clout here to pump and dump stocks. Everyone that follows him is a naive fool and basically handing him their money.  Not cool at all IMO.
11214,"GME retards hate when anyone brings up the blockbuster scenario. The reason they do is multi fold.   1. History repeats itself and some of us are trying to warn you.  2. Both were engaged in the  brick and mortar selling/renting of used media disks/cartridges. GME also sells consoles just like BB sold popcorn and candy and videogames too if I recall.   3. Both were leaders in their dying industry with little competition. BB had hollywood video and independent stores, GME  has digital sales and walmart as competition.   4. Both are/were run by complete fucking jokes of CEOs.  5. Both had  heavenly intervention where things could have turned around . For BB it was when Reed Hastings tried to get them to buy or at least invest in Netflix, the  BB CEO threw him out, then after the meeting they tried to launch a copycat service.  GME has Ryan Cohen offering to transform the company and buying up shares only to be rebuffed by the CEO/board which are willing to devalue and take a poison pill rather then try to change.  6. Both have  tried to branch out since Brick and mortar is expensive and dying. GME made a deal for a % of digital sells from MS, and is thinking of selling computer parts?? Like Best buy and Newegg don't exist. While Blockbuster started their Netflix clone I think it was called Blockbuster Direct or Connect or something like that, they also started selling videogames, music and old used stock, they would have sold you the movie promo displays if they could have made any money doing it.  7. They both got hit with massive reduction in B&amp;M  Sales for different reasons. With GME it was mostly COVID, Indoor malls during the Holiday season is just asking to get sued for anything that goes wrong. Blockbusters Covid was called the Internet/Bootlegs/torrents/redbox, none of which had late fees (remember those) you got charged for not returning stuff on time, sometimes multiple x  the amount of the rental for one day late.  8. It's a slow decline but it is declining. Blockbuster held on for years, there is still even  one store in Bend OR. But paying mall rents and teenagers getting $15 an hour to work a cash register while other sellers don't have these expenses is just not sustainable in the long run, unless there is high traffic, which there is not, and your marquee product is in low supply and has low margins even if you can sell it.  9. You are betting what seems like large amounts on two things:  A. That cohen wrests control from the jackasses currently in charge. Or the Short Squeeze saves you. Which 90+% of you haveprobably never been involved in a big infinity squeeze . Good luck trying to not be left holding bags. Or catching those knives. I'm pretty aumm my"

11216,Didn't that one tweet completely take Stripe off the table
11217,Give him the money. I read it.
11218,Every target is speculation...these are just the facts reported for the wsb consumer
11219,"It certainly stopped a lot of the speculation. Some think that it was a negotiation tactic. I want to be clear I am not saying anything atm in terms of claiming its 100% anything. I think the fact that they haven't just formally denied it and have formally denied an IPO. and are dramatically hiring public positions is at least interesting.  Its just a DD on a stock I like a lot. People can think whatever. zheng's comment (now deleted I see) is useless though, tbh. Just saying its not Stripe is not worth a comment so I am happy they deleted it, lol. That person knows as much as your dog as to what it is or isn't.  We are betting on ackman and the wild investor list and size of the spac here, make no mistake about that..."

11253,If Elon gets his way we all get our own planet. Chill dude.
11254,Can you call me and read it to me?
11255,Yeah that's a great point I forgot to add to the DD. What you just said plus how generous the spac is to small minority owned banks and underwriters. It truly is going to be a paradigm shift.
11256,The Autism Self Advocacy Network could be a better choice.  [https://autisticadvocacy.org/](https://autisticadvocacy.org/)  ... a friend told me.
11257,I mean I don’t really give a shit as long as he making me some cash but seeing all these 50 year old men stroking him on Twitter constantly is pretty g@y
11258,As if that matters at all
11259,"Pershing Square is Ackman's Hedge Fund.  It has ten holdings including a ton of PSTH warrants, that if exercises, give the hedge fund 6% of the SPAC.  Completely unique way to do it. Protects the regular shareholders but also gives him big incentive to make a great deal for everyone."
11260,"I wouldn't use ""reputable"" and ""ackman"" in the same sentence"
11261,I'm not 50 or gay but I would suck his dick if I thought I could buy into a holding company like that.
11262,"PSTH is the SPAC we’re discussing. PSH is his holdings company, which does happen to hold some of this plus his other investments like Lowe’s and Chipotle."
11263,I have June. Considering adding a lot of Dec but this stock already comprises a majority of my portfolio. Its hard not to go all in...especially with Q1 around the corner.
11264,July 22. We are 5 months in out of 24.
11265,"I can’t buy PSTH on my broker, is PSH basically the same or not?"

11270,"Good risk strategy. He has repeatedly called the LOI for Q1 but who knows maybe it gets pushed to April or May if it is a big fish...  EDIT: Those with June calls, I wouldn't worry. That's what I have and I am not considering the dec calls as a hedge. It just seems like a nice parallel plan (sell the June's early and then watch dec calls build through the fall as the stock appreciates)."
11271,Just bought some lol. Probably will expire worthless but fuck it.
11272,"Breadfruit if you’re out there, give me a sign!"
11273,"Exactly. Generous SPAC to small autists like us -&gt; activism, setting an example for future companies deciding to go public. Ackman is known as an activist. Collisons are known as activist. They’re a match made in heaven. Throw in these big names behind the SPAC and these brothers are able to have their net worth skyrocket. Buffett selling out of JPM and his big banks positions a big tell that BSH notices what is coming for big banks. Ackman taking a dig at the big credit card companies over PornHub last two weeks, gets name out there as the guy that “killed pornhub.” Good Publicity. Collisons choosing to IPO would go against everything they believe in. So why on earth would they choose to do that😂smh. SPAC is the only way."
11274,"The true beginnings of X-Men, Utilizing all that technology to become super humans in our own right."
11275,I wonder if $nga will get it . Lion electric all ready has electric trash trucks being used .
11276,&gt;Edit: wrong place but I'm not wrong  nah you are.
11277,"Its not the same at all. Get a real broker is my advice. Both robinhood and wealth simple (the dogshit iphone trading apps in USA and Canada, respectively, have psth."
11278,I'm talking more about the politicians themselves. Actions matter more than what color their billboards are you fucking retard
11279,I'm using for Q4 results. I think there will be a big wave that CRSR can ride for console accessories such as headsets and controllers with the new console cycle.
11280,"From my experience with SPACs, there’s two key events. The day they announce the deal and the day the actual tickers change. I think the ticker change will be the biggest, but since we don’t even have a deal yet we don’t know when the merger vote will be... so I feel like the q1 date is only part of the much bigger picture."
11281,my 30c's 2/19/21 at 4.05 sitting pretty at 12.05 right now
11282,So? How does that make him a reputable ceo? Do you even know what Valeant is?
11283,"I have a Corsair cooler in my PC and it hasn't caught fire yet, even when playing Cyberpunk, so I will keep holding my position."
11284,Yooooooo. GINORMOUS buy just now. What autist just read all this? GIANT Green Dildo
11285,I just used that example because its clear you didn't read the DD.   Do you know what Dexter Shoe Co is? Google it with the tag Buffet and then come back and tell me how poorly BRK.A and B have done.
11286,Yeah you've never heard of valeant lol ackman is a slime ball  Also no I haven't heard of it. How great of a success could it be hahahah
11287,"I’m not in the US sadly, but I found a broker which has it"
11288,"You just proved his point, CRSR does more than just sell RGB wink wonks to zoomers. By your logic, people should sell CHWY since it's nothing but pet food as well. CRSR's main selling point is ecommerce, they were early adopters. If they can resolve their debt by next year then they will increase in value much more, which isn't far away considering they obliterated their 2 year losses with just 6 months. Besides, PS5 just came out and holiday season, it is worth to hold it solely for Q4 earnings."
11289,He should name it 2 GENDERS ONLY: XX and XY
11290,Gonna use the call for a few few hundred shares later.
11291,"Most people with a brain will hold till Q4 earnings report anyway, then again we're on /r/WSB. Sell everything and all in GME 🚀 so we can make shorters hobos."
11292,"Okay. I mention valeant in the DD. Please, enough."
11293,Oh I hope so!
11294,Can anybody much smarter than me speak to the volume for the action the last 2 days? Is this real buying or some shorts covering or a mix of both?
11295,Oh shit hahaha fair enough  Can't blame me for not reading all that shit
11296,Actually LOL'd when I read this. Going to watch deadpool after this hahahahaha
11297,"Maybe I had an error in my head. Prob you‘re right, i‘m from Euroland so I may have calculated the exchange rate wrong"
11298,"Agree 100%. I would add that again, you are using the word or acronym SPAC in its traditional sense. As the DD covers (thanks for reading, btw), this PSTH thing is not a SPAC. Its more like an alien. And the one thing I want to add is that this stock is going to be resistant to large shifts in price downwards because of the tontine incentive. We have also seen that since it started trading. The moves have been within 1% up or down most days with a handful of 2-3% up days, a few 4% days and 1 big big day AND virtually no days being down a high %. In other words, it climbs, climbs a lot, settles to a new baseline and repeats."
11299,how is CRSR in ecommerce?  CRSR is all branding and premium products. nothing is stopping comps from doing the same
11300,That's why I suggested you google it. I fully anticipated the fact that you wouldn't know what Dexter Shoe Co was. I would guess this is the level of attention you give all important stock plays including PSTH.
11301,EOW 12/18 short interest data should be out sometime tomorrow for us to see where things stood before this glorious week.
11302,"I personally think thats big money adding more on the long side. If the shorts didnt cover in the mini-runups like this before I doubt they start now. Even if they do, theres no easy way to unwind 120% + SI without more upside for us longs at the levels we've been discussing."
11303,"I'm a huge Bull Ackman fan. I've looked into the Valeant thing pretty hard before buying shares of PSTH, and I think he was just as surprised. He was knowledgeable of the lack of RaD and the model being MaA for growth, but don't think he had any idea of the insurance fraud and price spikes that were causing the growth. I've listened to the famous call he had after the Phillidor thing came out and he seems legitimately...confused? Frustrated? Either way, I'm in. Think he probably learned his lesson on that one."
11304,It builds character.
11305,"Yeah I was too lazy to copy a comment I made on another thread saying basically the same.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiy348/ive\_been\_lurking\_for\_months\_since\_mid\_september/ggtijz4?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiy348/ive_been_lurking_for_months_since_mid_september/ggtijz4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)     I definitely think big players are buying in, they see the writing on the wall. The writing being, ""WSB is launching this bitch and no paper handed fucks in this gang. Shorties better buy $LUBE cause we are going in either way."""
11306,"To be fair, JPM calls are printing on stimmy and buyback rules"
11307,Same brother it is an acoustic haven lol
11308,there was some post that said it was mostly real buying  yesterday
11309,"&gt;CRSR is a peanut with nothing new but RGB  Lmao ok another vegetable who thinks they only sell RGB, you're confusing it with Razer and their garbage."
11310,"Yeah I mean that's all super reasoned. He had a huge misstep there. And herbalife was bad but for different reasons. That was the right short that just failed, it didn't fail like Tesla shorts failed, because Tesla is an incredible company.  Anyways, agree. I think the comparison here really is Dexter Shoe Co and Warren Buffet when he was at that stage of his career.  If you don't think Ackman is an investor whose on the rise and someone geneuinely cares about his shareholders go watch his cnbc spar with Carl Icahn on YouTube. The clip with the tv host guy moderating. He throws down some knowledge on real crooks like Icahn.  Here's the clip for others  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCZRk1lL90Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCZRk1lL90Q)"
11311,It outweighs it at 15% annualized return year over year. Buffet hits at 20%. Ackman is entering the goldilocks zone.
11312,"You can already buy stuff directly from Corsair's website, the problem is people still prefer to buy it straight from Amazon/NewEgg. Ecommerce being their MSP is a polarized point, I'm just asking people to hold till Q4 earnings report. Whether you want to invest or is not my problem"
11313,Its the manner in which he failed. I don't trust him with my money at all. You'll gonna chuck money at madoff again if he gets out of prison?
11314,"This is basically Alphabet/$googl, but for Musk."
11315,Well Elon musk is one of the overrated persons in the world
11316,"I missed it. Did Musk say this somewhere or something? The sex chromosome possibilities/possible tickers would be  45 \[X\], 45\[X\]-46\[XY\], 46 \[XX, XY\], 47 \[XYY, XXY, XXX\], 48 \[XXXY, XXXX\], and 49 \[XXXXY, XXXXX\]"
11317,Lmao u sound like a europoor cuck rn
11318,I joined you fellow retards for the first time today and got a poor mans 38 shares shortly after open. To the moon 🚀 gods speed
11319,"Every time somebody donates to Autism Speaks the comments are full of people explaining why Autism Speaks is a shit charity and how if you want to benefit autistic people you should pick a different charity. It’s one thing to be retarded with your options, it’s another to be retarded with your donations!"
11320,That analogy is so fallacious I'm not going to bother directly replying to it. I also have no vested interest in whether you buy your 10 or 20 shares of PSTH.  shrug sigh
11321,So you think he's going to fleece all the big players invested in PSTH? I don't think so
11322,I’m retarded so I assume everyone else is too
11323,WRONG daddy musk cares about me because he gave me SO MANY TENDIES
11324,"Not underrated if only the finest of autists understand what the fuck is happening. It’s rated like it is, rtarded"
11325,Stripe: there is no deal with PSTH   Retards: so you're saying there's a chance
11326,"Or a mining company in space, harvesting rare earths. Either way, $."
11327,"and you get another share at price of 23 for every common you hold.  AKA if you own 99 commons through the merger, you get 22 more shares at $23 cost each."
11328,Did you see how he landed rockets standing up?
11329,I’m honestly not holding any shares but I may have to park some cash in there now
11330,Bear credit spread 1/22/21 15/18 strike today because screw NKLA...  couldn’t go full autistic because these stupid companies can surprise.
11331,Ya. He's done it before.
11332,"PSTH is the one position where I'm so glad I had paper hands, got bored and sold when it pumped and moved on. It's probably been one of the most toxic plays of the second half of 2020 because of the sheer opportunity cost of locking up your capital in this while literally the entire market moons.   Heck there are at least 10 SPACs that you could have put your money and more than doubled instead of this OMG Ackman-reputation-of-course-it's-Stripe fomo"

11340,"camera is sideways, those are actually caught horizontally"
11341,KNOCK KNOCK STOCKS GO UP THE GAINS ARE REAL
11342,Don't  ya know Andrew Yang was a libertarian trojan horse?
11343,"haha someone told me I was dumb for selling covered calls on CRSR the other day.  Hold good stocks, especially with volatility,  just scoop up those juicy premiums all while never missing out on gains and less taxes come one year."
11344,"Nah, just caught me by surprise to see CRSR holders panicking in the midst of GME, PLTR rockets. I actually didn't expect anyone to hold CRSR since they do 0 marketing aside from earnings report. I expected people who know about CRSR to invest, not people looking for a short rocket. Then again this isn't /r/investing."
11345,"I remember you from my last post on PSTH. I wonder if you actually lost a lot on this play or something. The average investor isn't guaranteed to do well in a ""moon"" market, as many posts on this sub prove. The PSTH play is appealing to people because 1) news is imminent, 2) they can set it and forget it regardless even if they were in earlier 3) tontine and 4) there is downside capped risk.  Everyone loves playing with options and securities in this market, sure. But the idea that this isn't a nice short to medium term play is silly. The likelihood of a 3x return in a few months is high and investors don't have to be all in. They could throw a minority stake at it, forget about it until it pops, and then use the time to focus on the rest of the portfolio.  Ackman is also up 65% YTD. You're betting on that guy"
11346,"Holding 5/21 30C and 40C I’m all in on Corsair, gained and lost half my portfolio in one month but I’m diamond holding these bad boys"
11347,Another X and it is now a totally different business.
11348,So is my 2/19 50c gonna print?
11349,it should be called Edison. The better Tesla
11350,"I didn't lose any money on PSTH. I first bought in when the units launched. Sold my warrants when they split and made good money on them. sold units when they spiked to $25. Bought back when they trended down and then the Stripe hype took off - sold off at $27 and haven't been back in PSTH.   1) No one is guaranteed anything. However, it's a pity if people missed out incredible opportunities and catalysts like the TSLA S&amp;P inclusion because they were so wedded to the PSTH-Stripe idea  2) If people wanted a safe play then the time to buy PSTH was when it just launched and was simply trading at common + implied warrant price. For anyone getting into PSTH now you are paying a massive premium over common at NAV + 2/9 warrant.   3) Just as the rest of the market doesn't guarantee anything, PSTH doesn't guarantee 3X mooning either. It really depends on the target, the valuation and the state of the broader market at the time."

11375,"I use CRSR parts for my computer, so I've been following them since I first heard that they are gonna IPO this year. Numbers looked absolutely great on their S1 and other SEC forms; this is a typical retail company that Wall St would love, unlike some of our beloved meme stocks. I was surprised that it didn't skyrocket on the IPO day so I went all-in. It paid off half of my student debt past Thanksgiving when it went over $50 LOL. Still holding Feb and May calls. 💪 These guys will rip even harder after next earnings. I tried to buy more of their mouse /mouse pad /keyboards to honor my gains but everything is f'in sold out.  I feel great for the next earnings report."

11385,"lol at everyone who thinks elon gives a flying fuck about you, or humanity...   the only reason he wants to go to mars, is to save himself and his rich buddies from this dystopia we're living in. ever seen the movie elysium?  sure, we're all along for the ride to the moon right now. but once we get there, he's going to abandon us on the side of the road like an unwanted puppy. then he rockets off to mars leaving us all behind in the wreckage... papa?"

11438,Back in the days in 2019 you had to pay millions to an investment banker to get M&amp;A advice. Elon has crowdsourced deal making. Why do market research when you can just tweet an offer to take a company private and watch the reaction? Why pay huge commission when you can just use the advice of some rando on Twitter? Why hire a lawyer when you can tweet sexually suggestive comments to the SEC and get away with it?
11439,Isn’t 2020 a beautiful thing

11441,"**[X.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com)**  X.com was an online bank founded by Elon Musk in November 1999. In March 2000, X.com merged with Confinity Inc., a software company based in Silicon Valley. Musk was attracted to Confinity because of its easy payment system. The merged company changed its name to PayPal.

11456,Do it
11457,"Again I think there is massive protection against any sell offs. People who get in and stick with it for a bit will see it through the merger. There will also be less panic selling because it won't drop a ton on any given day after LOI.  Anyways I think you can expect 100-150% gain on LOI with the press that will come with that. Lots and lots of people sitting on the sideline waiting.  Longer term it depends on target. I think the fact that Stripe and Bloomberg are leading the race and considering who's on the board (fintech and media people mostly) its going to be quality. If LOI in Q1, merger and listing will happen around 45 days later. Post merger I can see this stock jumping another 50-100%. This is totally speculative and based on my impression of the size, likely targets, and how some other special acquisition plays have worked and how this one has advantages over them.  Price target post merger (45-55 days after LOI in Q1) : $75-100  Again, total speculation. We don't know the target. I suspect its chosen already and they are waiting to time it perfectly."

11464,Feel like this comes up all the time but people are misrepresenting the tontine structure. Those warrants only get redistributed if a share holder elects not to go through with the merger and redeem for the 20$ it has nothing to do with selling on the open market at announcement. That being said I’m balls deep in this and am hoping to ride to Mars

11497,Important to point out that the new generation of hardware from NVDA and AMD are huge upgrades compared to the last couple of gens. People on 5 year upgrade cycles for their PCs are frothing at the mouth for these new CPUs and GPUs.  When people upgrade to these new platforms they'll need new compatible accessories. CRSR's ecosystem of peripherals is probably the best in the business so I can't see their next earnings being anything but spectacular.

11509,So we just let Elon decide what is human progress then?  Do we care about his human rights violations getting lithium for batteries from war torn countries ? Or taking Saudi money that’s stained with decades of blood   I know criticising Elon here is an instant downvote but no one even looks past their current Tesla returns or cares what the guy is involved in  Pick a better champion if you want someone to save the world. Elon is the most successful business person of the century but he’s not a saint by any means
11510,Richest person on earth or the fourth richest person on earth.. probably makes no difference to the person. After a point money is just a number.. it’s what you leave behind matters.

11547,"Saying TSLA to the moon just doesn't cut it. This man made SpaceX. The company that put a Tesla in space. That Tesla Roadster is over 215 million miles away from us right now. In short, the moon just a walk to your neighbor's house for Elon. TSLA to the center of the milky way, where the price gets pulled so far up it becomes a continuum. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
11548,"Hmm? There are a few projects going, small tunnels. Gotta walk before running, and you have to have tunnels on Mars."
11549,Yeah but it's not the parent company I will only buy stock in it if it's the parent company
11550,"I'm kinda with the other guy, got tired of having money tied up doing nothing.  Might be back in later after some announcement.  But between ackman, the board, the big investors, and the opportunity cost...eh.  going to be hard to live up to hype."

11555,"Why did musk want to sell Tesla to Apple? Like if he knew the success it would have had why would he do that? If he is so laser focused how does he find time to play vidya and tweet? Lastly, the model three was one of the worst vehicles Tesla produced, I understand they have fixed those issues but still. What am I missing here?"

Musk was attracted to Confinity because of its easy payment system. The merged company changed its name to PayPal. eBay bought PayPal for US$1.5 billion in 2001.[1]"
11572,"Good idea: except these are government programs funded mainly to help the US government kill people better.  &amp;#x200B;  You really need to be an out of touch virgin to think that Musk is at all in touch with the struggles of humanity.

11578,I'll settle for a astroid with WiFi and a killer man cave. Earth is boomer shit.
11579,Now just buy out Tesla
11580,You've got it all wrong. Papa Elon will be the richest person ON THE MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
11581,"Well yeah. If he succeeds in a true FSD, he become the first trillionaire faster than he climbed the billionaire rankings.   If the bull case succeeds, he'll be worth more than the current GDP of the USA in 2030. Not shitting you. Just on Tesla.   This motherfucker is going to have to consider writing the entirety of the US a 3000 dollar check so people dont fucking riot because he could buy the US debt. It'll be stupid. It'll be disgusting. I'm gonna be eating popcorn and cackling. He'll need to fuck off to Mars just to avoid being the next Marie Antoinette. Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook are going to cry into their monopoly money.   https://youtu.be/qn6BoN4526I  From video, bull case is Tesla market cap of 100 trillion 2030. And the bull case assumptions are all conservative. Like, the actual fuck, lol.   🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  If Starlink gets added, Elon will become the Capitalism Final Boss. Bill Gates will ask him for funding. The fuck do you even do with a trillion dollars? I dont think even going to Mars is sufficient unto spending that amount of money. Seriously. If he sold Tesla then would the economy crash? Like WTF, I have no idea what this amount of fuck off rich would result in.   I wanna say a buffer overflow and then Elon will have negative money."

11585,"Yeah, I was gonna say... ""good idea"" like he didn't already have it, develop it, sell it for huge amounts of cash, and use that to fuel his other business ventures.  Pretty sure paypal still owns all that shit, buying it from them seems more expensive than is reasonable. But we are talking about Elon Musk, here..."
11586,"It think if Elon could sell Tesla to his own company to take it private, and lock in all his capital gains by taking it from investors, he would have done that 4 years ago."
11587,"When I saw ""X"", the first thing that comes to mind was DMX and X gon give it to ya. If Elon actually forms a holding company called ""X""...this will be FIRE!!!! All-in with calls to the moon."
11588,"Probably better if he doesn't, though. The whole point is SpaceX can't prototype and develop so quickly with stockholders. He's burning huge amounts of cash to get stuff done quickly, instead of being like everyone else and doing tests on a super slow timeline.  Once they actually operate as a business, maybe. But he'll still want to do R&amp;D and shit without worrying about stockholders being like ""nooo don't spend money being revolutionary, we want to wait for decades to develop something you could build this year"""
11589,"RIP, I wish I had funds then. I think TWTR is getting ready for a breakout soon so maybe there's a play there."

11598,Steel is already the official stock of DMX so back off!
11599,"That shit would be great. This sub would literally never run out of material. Every new day there would be a thousand new memes about whatever weird fucking fraud came to light that day. And I'm sure there would be some weirdo traveling to Nigeria to get pictures of himself on one of the Enron barges.   Then there would be some loser in the corner trying to make WorldCom memes. Fuck outta here, nobody gives a shit about boring WorldCom fraud."

11601,"You buy the peak idiot, that way you get to have a fun slide to go on"
11602,"Losses capped at NAV of $20 per share. So you get $20 if you don't sell before it drops. A deal is going to be made though. The terms are so attractive that any of the 150 companies in the pool would make more sense than abandoning the SPAC. A deal will 100% be made.  Ackman has also said as recently as their last investor call that the timeline hasn't changed and they are on course for Q1 announcement. He wouldn't say just say that if it wasn't true. He knew he had a deal with someone at that point probably. And the intermittent time is negotiation. There's also a timing element which may make it favorable to wait until 2021 for LOI if a deal has been struck. If I had money on this, which I do, I would guess early to mid Q1 (Jan - middle of feb ish) for announcement and then merger end of Q1."

11638,Somehow he rallied the funding and organization to make it happen.  He had the grit to get the idea into reality by assembling an engineering team and providing them the means.  Name someone else accomplishing such great things with a team.

Couldn't bring myself to take the profit now when I know these shares will be at least 50 by end of 2021. Have one more $15 call that expires 12/31 and will probably do the same.

11787,Are we retarded?
11788,You're bleeding $113 in Theta every single day. So many other ways to yolo 20k that would have better outcome. BTW your break even is higher than the 52 week high. I wish you luck at your new job in the Wendy's drive through!
11789,Someone posted  GME short squeeze is once in a lifetime opportunity. So I have set the limit sell at 50$. Should I increase the ask price ?
11790,I only had a bit to put in so only up $200. Good job for you
11791,"Hah. It's possible. But I don't really want anything. I just want to be free to go hiking mostly. Nearly 30 and making 13.5/hr.  The struggle continues.  Regardless, keep stacking the chips, you're doing well. Consider a charitable donation or a small scholarship that you can sponsor!"

11805,Rumour has it that PLTR operates out of Area 51 👀👀👀
11806,"Can't find options, only the stock. Am I blind or is this possible?"
11807,Basically they take normal gas vehicles (commercial trucks) and make them into an EV making it more of a hybrid. Saw Cramer pump this last Friday premerger and bought calls Monday and yesterday when the ticker changed. Not everyone had access to trading under the ticker so volume was super low. Then today this company rings the opening bell then has an interview on CNBC and it moons
11808,Usually spacs don’t have options until the target is officially acquired.
11809,"I might make a DD post on this at some point soon... but WFC will moon in late Q1/early Q2. make sure you are buying calls beyond Q1 and nothing sooner. Seems to be coming back right now, but the real blast off will come late Q1."
11810,"I have no idea what that means so I think I'm in the right place, just buying whatever you people are shilling."
11811,It's a live show
11812,Selling CSPs until March. Very curious to see how they perform.
11813,"But that’s not the whole story. This company both:  a) went public with their hack as soon as they discovered it, unlike the others.  b) discovered that their hack was part of a much larger hack that endangered national security.   If anything, they’re running because they’re the only ones who actually discovered the extent of the hack and tried to do something about it.  Either way, who cares. I made $10k tendies this week off of an initial $450 buy on Friday.   Positions:  10 $16.5c expiring 12/24 rolled into 30 $20.5c expiring 12/24 rolled into 100 $25c expiring 12/24.   Just sold the $25c because I got scared, but looks like I could’ve made quite a bit more."
11814,"Lmao, one of the best ive seen. I just keep watching it"
11815,"Started investing not long ago and I can't buy options on firstrade, I applied but been waiting forever"
11816,They'll do a live sex with papa Karp on January 7

11820,Sweet gains. Are you going to keep holding? I got in 30c 3/19 couple weeks ago.
11821,No one gives a fuck about $30 mill. Go spam /r/PLTR
11822,Vanguard. They just came out with a new app called Beacon
11823,You doing Jan calls? Anything further seems like a waste of time
11824,Yes still holding these I keep jumping in and out of $25 &amp; $30 contracts to secure some gains.   Also jumping in and out of GME.  Holding shares on both companies.
11825,Fuck this video.  Everytime I see it.
11826,A Christmas ... what’s the opposite of miracle?
11827,You remember the $44M contract with the Greek Gov't that resulted in a 10% jump in PLTR's stock price? You probably don't cause you're a ghey bear with no skin in the game. GTFO you fucking vegan fuck.
11828,Forgot one big positive.  They are going to be releasing a next gen version of the Witcher 3 in 2021 if it doesn't get delayed.  This will sell like pancakes.  If only they had options.
11829,"Nice! Now get some tendies from its brothers PERI, CRTO and F L N T!  I am basically holding half the ad tech industry atm and its amazing"
11830,"I sold this yesterday when it was trading @ $22.30. I had 3.19.21 20c 25c 30c and also 1.2021 30c. Bought those all Friday when $feye broke $16, sold for +500%, felt like it was going too fast and needs a pullback to reality. Then news came after hours of 2 insiders selling shares at 17.71 and 19.15, which tells me I was right to sell even if its a bit too early. Im still going to be long term bullish and buy back leaps probably when this thing trades back in reality because I think 2021 is cyber year. Everything has a processing power, and '21 going to focus on security bigly am sure of it."

11834,"Besides the satire post, PLTR is actually a great company with solid fundamentals. If you look at the chart its consolidating well and will go up to 30+ within the next few weeks. Early Jan. Follwed by the Jan 7 News. This will surely moon. Buy now! PLTR 40C Mar !"
11835,I added this to my watchlist last night and didn’t wake up on time this morning 🤨 when did you get in on these for .94?

11837,"It's going to peak today so sell at end of day, most stocks crash on christmas eve, and the whole reason why this is rising is cheap fomo for those who can't afford the other cyber security stocks.  Sell close to close today and but a put for tomorrow."

11861,"Shoulda sold. But it’s cool, reinvest in GME and you’re good."
11862,Nov
11863,LOL. What the hell was that ipo? What a bunch of garbage. It’s not manipulation when you just flat out suck
11864,GME needs to get into the cloud gaming industry like stadia. Consoles are going to be obsolete when building your own PC is becoming much more achievable. The partnership with MSFT makes me think GME is well positioned to do this but nothing in this regard has yet to be seen.
11865,GME SHARES &amp; CALLS
11866,"Not a trust fund. Earned it. Flat broke in 2000, started a business in 2001. Nose to the grindstone, working 80-100 hours a week, even now."
11867,"Yeah, it did. It tried to break into streaming by buying Movielink, but it was too late. Netflix was already the leader. This is years after BB blew it when Hastings actively tried to get BB to buy Netflix."
11868,Short it? Hell I had calls and still lost
11869,Fidelity has a “invest dollar amount” feature.  This is the child that bursts forth...
11870,"The fuck is a ""Blockbuster""?"
11871,"To the moon, baby!  Can’t wait until the merger is complete.  It’s a good business. My wife is a doctor. She’s familiar with Butterfly.   ARK Invest bought 460,000 shares.   Good underlying business."
11872,These retards will never understand until they are balls deep in calls again like the last GME run up. Company has no future whatsoever. The stock is a zombie
11873,$7000 is my life saving. Please show this autistic a little respect.
11874,"Oh fuk, I know her. LMAO I gotta text Kayla now"
11875,I’ve been in this for weeks now.
11876,Buy high sell low
11877,Solid DD
11878,Then it’s alpha centaury
11879,"Tell me when GME changes their business model and formulates a decent business plan to survive against Amazon, best buy, target etc.  Oh shit wait... Yall still have your finger up your ass hoping dickbag Cohen magically changes shit"
11880,"Keep it goin, tendies flowin."
11881,"$24-26, seems to have strong support around 25 and I wouldn't mind buying at that price."
11882,"Uh, BB tried and failed to adapt.  They tried to work with Enron to put together a fiber video streaming network in 2001, ran a DVD by mail system in 2004 that had 1.5 M subscribers that Netflix sued them over, and had an online streaming service for rentals ""Blockbuster Total Access"" and then a Blockbuster On Demand.  They sucked at it, but they tried.  They have some kind of thing still going with Sling too."
11883,May as well sell the kids and the wifey...
11884,"Overcharging was not the sole or even primary reason why BB failed, its because people got tired of schleping in and out of the store every week for a VHS or DVD that had a 50/50 shot of not being available for rental due to demand. If overcharging was the lone problem, then why did all of BB's cheaper video competitors go under too."
11885,"nope, its a dogshit polish company."
11886,There are “feelings” and then there’s the facts on the balance sheet.  This isn’t blockbuster.  This is a rocket ship stopping at the moon for some tendies and then on to Proxima Centauri to father Cohen’s home world 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
11887,"delete this... we shall profit off the idiots, don´t tell them to early"
11888,Now post the other leg of this spread.
11889,"Literally won't do shit to fix the damage cyberpunk has done. It barely sold more than witcher 3 and thats because of witchers reputation. The cost to have the game pulled out the store and then having to go through even more crunch just to fix it and make it playable is too much of a loss. Also they already have witcher 3 on switch, ps4, PC and the new consoles are harder to get rn. Witcher 3 on ps5 won't save them at all"
11890,Having $60k to bankroll an options play.    &amp;#x200B;  Well done OP!
11891,Calls have an expiration so the getting out is already priced in. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕
11892,Not generally arguing against your point there - but self built gaming PCs are and will forever be a niche for just a margin of people compared to consoles and prebuilt PCs figures.
11893,"Leaps. You can’t go against the church of musk and not expect to get burned. Gotta wait for people to realize that there is no second coming of Christ and their conviction turns into hatred, will shorts BEGIN to make money. My 2c."
11894,Lmao have you not seen the 5-day chart? You're up 52%!
11895,It has to be manipulated! Every time it almost hits $30 it goes down ! And there is so much hype behind it you cannot tell me it is not !
11896,Icahn is a boomer. Fuck boomers.  Cohen is a millennial. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕
11897,"Baught in 2Days ago. Thanking all cry kiddos in advance for letting it drop :) This will be going up good %%% mid next year. Cyberpunk ist one of the best games, they already sold and will sell more. Huge fan base.  Same happen to Witcher 3 everyone crying at release and now it's mentioned one of the best games :)"
11898,Wanna buy them? I’ll take 100 shares of PLTR  Edit: I’ll go as low as 25 shares*
11899,"Protip: hitting the strike might turn that shit into a rocket ship but it doesn't need to for him to make some money.   I have calls for GME and I'm up 50% on them. They're 27 strike but they rise in value as the share price goes up. As long as it goes up faster than theta burns it he makes money.   You don't need to hit strikes to make money on calls, guys."
11900,"You just haven't been reading, retarded fetus. People have been talking about MGNI when it was still $18"
11901,This is a scam. Don't get duped by op
11902,Being a uk peasant options aren’t easily available
11903,"Simple - if you know its going up, you want to go all in. And all-in doesn't mean ""round it up to nearest zero"" it means ""I'ma sell my grannies jewelry just to buy another 16 stocks"""
11904,This is a clear and obvious wave 4 triangle. Non Elliot guys also see these patterns and trade them but knowing EW well really helps know the direction and timing of when it will break out. This will break up but the count isn’t done. Triangles need 5 waves denoted ABCDE and each of which will be 3 sub waves. I only count ABCD so far. So we should have a small down/up/down to compete the E sub wave (i.e. go we test the bottom of the triangle one more time) and then we will push back to the top and break out. Honestly this example is so clean it could be used in a text book.
11905,This is wallstreet bets not stocks or investing. Doesn't matter if we're smart or lucky we're just here for the fucking tendies.
11906,"I would gladly explain it to you, but i have been explained this only 5 times so i still don't get it. All i know is that a lot of people did their dd and it was long. Soooo here i am now 4k into this position"
11907,I wouldn’t mind a few bucks youngMidor
11908,That's a big if.
11909,"Don't need to get out at the height, just need to get out when it's made me a bunch of money and I feel good about it. The super greedy might get punished, just have to keep some perspective.   I got limit orders in place to cover costs and guarantee gains, even if a bit modest"
11910,"It's Ginger Root's little brother, so back off, retard."
11911,1/15 $22.50c For now.
11912,"Keep acting like a pig and get slaughtered. When you plead with forums out of greed because you want more, you have just generated your own indicator as to why you should take profit."
11913,"The thing I find funny about PLTR is how the boomer analysts fail to realize is that the company also has a civilian platform and is custom tailored based on the client's needs. What this means for people invested in the company is what OP is noting, that there is a significant backlog of incoming contracts that can be publicized and will drive this thing to up.      ""**Cows go moooooo, cats go meoewww, what sound does PLTR make? BRRRRRRRRR""**   Is this a Ylvis-What does the fox say reference? If so, you fracking genius."
11914,"Yeah no, MSFT partnership makes no difference here either right? Its just RC?   Ffs you are fucking retarded.   If blockbuster could have gotten turned around like this, it would have done well. People don't often bode well to change, they like familiarity.   Gamestops rapid adaptation to a more digital world will send them back up to ATH and you'll be the one watching me fuck your wife for a dime on the dollar."
11915,So dumb comparing BB to GME. 2 completely different business models and markets.
11916,"How about you provide your rationale for making these allegations? Where in my post did I try to ""scam"" anybody on WSB? If you search for PLTR news on Google, you'll find everything that I've posted. Regardless, I'll give you a pass because I'm guessing you didn't learn to think independently while you were in school.   I'm not a financial advisor - if you invest solely because of a WSB post without conducting your own DD, you probably shouldn't be managing your money."
11917,Because short interest is at 137% and the stock is squeezed tighter than titties in a strippers top.
11918,Haha yea so rapid that they haven't even figure it out yet in 2020?!?! Even when all their competition already has?Are you fucking retarded? Buy $30 calls right fucking now for January. Throw your money away. Every GME bagholder needs to buy $30 GME calls for January. Money where your mouth is. Don't cry about MMs manipulating shit when 1/15 comes
11919,"Thanks for this  Edit: don’t know much about EW particularly, any price target guidance on a breakout?"
11920,"No shit. I understand OTM plays, and taking profit, but seeing this guys prior plays i dont think thats the case here boss..  I would take profits ASAP and roll it into later dated calls and buys some more fucking shares too"
11921,lol no now is when it dips and you hold onto $25 GME shares for two months
11922,Yes but what you failed to take into account is this market makes no sense. So for it to make sense you have to do what doesn’t makes sense
11923,Why are you bullish on them if you don’t mind sharing?
11924,"Don't get a lambo...get a condo and a corolla.  You don't realize how much of a pain in the ass those cars are until youve had one, or are smart and believe people with them. There is a reason so many billionaires drive a lexus."
11925,I feel for you but life savings on a negative bet is bad juju.
11926,[What you said.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag)
11927,why did u do that? lmao...next time use a straddle if you are unsure about the direction of the price.
11928,I  knew it was BS when there were no rockets in the tldr
11929,December has been a terrible month for me as well
11930,"Why the fuck would I buy january calls for a progressing speculative value play. Jesus fucking christ and youre sitting here calling **me** the retard.   I have dated calls and shares, and im not banking on a cheesy short squeeze for profits. Im on board for this shit because its a great company that millions of people STILL use.   Put your money where your mouth is. Short it.   Or shut the fuck up  Edit for positions:  700 shares  Fuckload of various strikes (15, 17, 25) for 04/16/21"
11931,"The difference is Bb never was able to compete w netflix. Gamestop has ryan cohen, who successfully built chewy during the time amazon was pretty much dominant. Its basically like saying netflix was already established and then a small video company was able to compete and actually win with them. His expertise along with gaming being a huge huge market will i think foster a turn around. But I understand the bearish points tho i just think the bull case is stronger."
11932,Each game has own app. They pure profit.. there are a lot of retards spending money on them.
11933,"But none are available on the app stores.... You have to go to a website and ignore a big warning that says: DONT DOWNLOAD, YOU'LL GET HACKED!"
11934,It's not exactly BB because GME has the cash to service the long term debt. But it's not exactly a rocket ship because the turnaround is still a hope and a prayer.
11935,"The whole ad tech space is interesting, especially with the take off of CTV.   Look into other players in the sector too. I have large positions in PERI and F L N T. They have much lower valuations than MGNI and just starting to get attention.   PERI has a 4 year deal with Microsoft and is the second biggest holding in ARK's Israel ETF."
11936,"Hi Guys, Those who follow CD Projekt know that I have been posting about it since November. I rode it up with 130k stake and sold upon game release when I saw the reviews. Pocketed 20\~30k in the process  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj4u0a/cyberpunk\_2077\_release\_on\_nov\_19\_2020\_cd\_projekt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj4u0a/cyberpunk_2077_release_on_nov_19_2020_cd_projekt/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/juzord/cyberpunk\_2077\_will\_not\_be\_further\_delayed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/juzord/cyberpunk_2077_will_not_be_further_delayed/)  If it wasn't due to wash trading rules I would be buying some today. I'll wait until mid Jan to make sure wash trading doesn't complicate things, even though it should not apply.   Board of directors owns 1/3 of the float and two founders own 24%."
11937,"Congrats!  Some questions if you don’t mind  What exactly is digital advertising inventory?  Also, why are you bullish on this company?"
11938,That’s something a 🏳️‍🌈🐻boomer would say. Rather than being happy for us you got to put us down.   Join the GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to tendietown or GTFO.
11939,"Unfortunately not everyone reads a company's prospectus before investing (I get it, it's a lot of words... but it's your money) or works with the type of software that PLTR develops. A couple hours spent looking through the prospectus and the vast majority of investors would understand the significant commercial applications of PLTR's software.   This software is not exclusive to government application. It is so much more than that... and I'm sure that January is going to be a helluva month for PLTR. They're likely going to report some of these commercial contracts around the time the demo goes live to gain  further commercial credibility. If anything, the DD provided by the other poster whereby they noted job listings with ""PLTR experiences as an asset"" reinforces the idea that their commercial footprint is going to grow immensely in the near future.  Thanks for catching the reference! I'm glad at least one person did. 🤣"
11940,"You're invested, and you want other people to invest so that your assets go up.  So you post this. Seems like a scam to me."
11941,"You could:  Sell $50 to 55 puts if you want premium.   Buy $60 calls if you want levered upside.  Buy the stock if you don’t want to worry about timing, and would just love a great entry point on a total return play that should easily beat the market."
11942,"My point is it’s no different than gambling on any of these EV companies that don’t make a dollar. They’re all ways to make money riding a wave, not being able to get out before your account goes to zero isn’t specific to GME"

11945,The dude is going to be swimming in tendies. He can just buy a new lambo when the other one gets dirty.
11946,"I understand what you mean. I’m just looking towards a possible future. I want GME to do well but the current paradigm of cyclical console cycles is underwhelming. In other countries, they are teaching kids how to code in elementary school. Building a pc is going to be a piece of cake for the next generation of gamers. I’m an idiot and even I can take apart my laptop and do maintenance periodically. If GME were to reposition itself as the sort of digital store front to cloud gaming and esports, that would be something. News of this would cause GME to moon like never seen before. The merger with MSFT really got me thinking about this. MSFT already has a beta of a cloud gaming platform allowing you to play almost anywhere. GME could be the digital storefront/gate keeper to this new paradigm shift.  I work in the architecture field and we use cloud rendering which has transformed the industry. Couple with the fact that the unreal gaming engine is used in architecture rendering really got me thinking about this. Imagine running a game on a super computer in the cloud rather than a simple console. Add in cloud/networking capability sold as a subscription service like we’re seeing in other industries and this shit would be wild. I’m guessing people like u/deepfuckingvalue understands this because of the long term basis of their investments. If GME came out with a cloud gaming service, they could transform the entire f’ng gaming industry instead of hedging their bets on successive console cycles. Idk, all pure speculation of course."
11947,So all of WSB is a scam? Great logic bud. We wouldn't be on here if we weren't invested in the stock market.
11948,Oh man.  Disney+ is gonna get ads now?   Or am I out of the loop and do they already have them?  Edit:  and thanks for the DD.  Interesting play.
11949,Found it somewhere on Reddit so I just downloaded it
11950,"Yup yup. PERI and F L N T are my two main plays in this sector right now in addition to MGNI and APPS. Run just beginning on PERI and F L N T (big runs today though, so buy on a pullback). Still room to go on MGNI too. All are big holdings for me right now into 2021. Awesome sector right now."
11951,You’re actually absolutely correct.
11952,"No matter how much money you have, its fucking annoying when you realize you bought the most expensive car that doesnt actually go anywhere faster than a toyota but doesnt work half the time, and you're just shoveling money into a dealership full of people you despise personally and professionally.  I have a car thats faster than an RC-F but costs less due to depreciation. I'd rather have the lexus if i had more money than i knew what to do with."

11957,"In general when you see a triangle you should always be thinking wave 4. You rarely see a wave 2 triangles. I say that b/ wave 5s are the hardest to predict a top on. Could have blowoff top, who knows. I would start taking profits at the .618 fib level of wave 1 through 3 which would be around $36.50. But we’ll see the sub waves of the larger degree wave 5 as they develop and that should provide better guidance on targets.  Edit: as for targets to enter, E may not go that low, maybe 25.50ish so just get in wherever. As long as the triangles holds longs we are safe. If we break out at all to the downside, count needs to be completely reassessed)."
11958,"Sure, I’ll throw $1000 in  EDIT: Make it 2500 and meme this bitch to the moon"
11959,It's a tech company though.
11960,"I asked for a refund for the game and sold my shares.  But I'm definitely coming back for more. With the 13 millions sold (and that's including refunds, and BEFORE the last minute buy for Christmas ) + the millions more that will be sold as soon as the patches come (I include myself), I wouldn't be surprised if it went back near its ATH."
11961,Bear thesis- “I don’t know”  Sounds about right.
11962,so in other words...     ONE OF US
11963,You big on EW as well?

11965,AAPL Feb calls.  They’re gonna crush earnings.
11966,Witcher 4 will save them. Besides I guarantee cyberpunks full potential will be unlocked in coming month as will sell like hot cakes once major updates are released and people get word of it. The company makes great games.  They just screwed up the release pretty bad which translated to a sale on the stock price for me but to each their own.  Time will tell whose right but I know where my money is.
11967,I took a look at PERI. I see most of their revenue is from search (MSFT Bing contract). Their investor materials claim a lot of CTV exposure driving revenue but don’t really explain how. You have any idea how that works? Adtech is a little new to me.
11968,"Not for a couple years. This should be a longer play for folks after the recent run up. Buy June calls and hold. Better yet, buy shares."
11969,"This seems like a lot of confidence for a company that most recently grew only 12% year over year.  I know the headline ran with 62% growth and some of the financial sites show that 62% as well. But from their own quarterly press release, that is not the actual growth rate.   Magnite revenue was $61.0 million for Q3 2020, up 62% from Q3 2019 on an as reported basis and up 12% on a pro-forma basis  Third quarter 2020 financial results of Magnite represent the combined performance of Rubicon Project and Telaria, which merged on April 1, 2020. Third quarter 2019 comparative numbers do not include results from Telaria, unless noted as pro-forma.  Telaria was around a $15M/quarter company. So the 62% doesn’t take into account nearly 25% of the combined company total revenue into the comparable. And when you look at the comparable it’s only 12% growth for the combined company.   Further the mobile and desktop grew about 3% YoY. And CTV accounted for $11M and 18% of revenue and grew at 51%. At $11M that should be growing near triple digits to be anywhere near matching the narrative. $11M and 51% are pathetically small numbers for what should be a hypergrowth market. And that CTV growth rate has fallen like a rock every quarter.  The guidance is similarly weak at $75M at top of guide. The Q4 combined comparable is $68.1M, implying 10-11% growth. Q4 is a seasonally larger quarter for both of the Magnite companies. As typical you can expect Q1 guide to show a decline QoQ. And probably continued 10-12% growth.  There are far better companies to invest in this space."
11970,"Disney+ doesn’t have ads, OP’s post about Mandalorian is irrelevant. Disney relationship is significant because they own Hulu, which has an ad-supported version."

11973,"Little differents BB had 1 billion dollar in debt, no cash and was failing to pay it's bills.    GME has none of that. They still have more cash than liabilities until the 2023 bonds come due. So any bankruptcy thesis before summer of 2023, has to explain how."
11974,"Yeah I keep it simple tho. I mainly use EW and Fibonacci. If you look at the PLTR chart right now, we’re about to begin the final 5th leg for EW. Once the move finally happens it could go up to $40 so cash out your calls"
11975,I agree I keep hearing its “unplayable” on ps4.  Literally me and my best friend have been enjoying the “unplayable” version on ps4 with little to no issue.  It’s a little janky but damn people are dramatic and investors panicked.  Opportunity to get in low is what I see in this situation.

So if you have a plan, what's your exit price or strategy?"
11977,Someone keeps selling the shit out of this when it hits $22.
11978,I just looked up 21 blitz and it sent me to the same website. I don't even see it on the Google play app store. It forced a browser download and gave me the same warning. What am I missing here?
11979,you're a legend
11980,Underlying company has been around since 2011 and is reputable.   Wife is a doctor at a major hospital and she’s very familiar with the company. She was surprised when she heard me mention the product and that it was becoming public. She bought shares also.   ARK invest also has a position in LGVW. That’s a mark of confidence.   Good underlying company.
11981,"MVIS leap, and you will make all that money back, and then some."
11982,Yup I also heard pc has nearly no problem and the all the cry kiddos really live in an echo camper of their own made up pain.  Most normal people seem to enjoy the game slot and there are not many refunds I would guess. They ready sold over 13million copys.  So for me this is a pretty safe play and I somehow support a company I like anyway 😂
11983,"Looks like it is actually a once in a decade opportunity, but yeah. 2008, 2020, probably again by 2030."
11984,"Yep insert any hot new streaming show in place of Mandalorian, example just used to show CTV/streaming growth.   Relatedly, HBO Max is expected to come out with an ad-supported version in the spring. Would be a huge catalyst if magnite was involved"

11988,"Hey James, if you're reading this: fuck you! You're not fucking funny. Get your fat fuck off the air."
11989,Cohen is trying to do the exact opposite of what Icahn did with Blockbuster. So the result should be the opposite.  GME 🚀🚀
11990,You are already at 7 digits???
11991,The market has thrown reasonable out the window.

11995,I got it on Apple so not sure.
11996,It doesn’t even have to moon. Even if it only moves up another 2$ if he put it all on 30c for like March or something he will make an asinine amount of money.    Maybe not a 10 bagger but maybe 2/3x
11997,Daddy Elon has blessed us once again
11998,"Key number is the 51% CTV growth, and the several drivers of growth over the next year. I think you’re getting bogged down in the weeds on things that don’t matter here.  If you have a better stock with pure-play exposure to these drivers, that hasn’t run up like TTD and ROKU, do share"
11999,"&gt;To Jupiter's moons we go.  We are going to a new solar system fool, $1400 is the target."
12000,"It's definitely riskier, but my cost basis is already reduced to 23 even if I get assigned. I also like dating mine 30 days out since theta decay accelerates quickly in the last month so I get better returns."
12001,"Carl Icahn's style is investing in crappy companies that he believes have value in their CURRENT business model. For the Blockbuster trade, he saw its rental DVD business as sustainable (at least in terms of future cash flows, i.e. long enough for him to make a large profit) and undervalued by the market relative to its intrinsic value. In terms of Ryan Cohen, he sees that GME's current B&amp;M business model is dead and wants to shift away from that by leveraging the brand name and customer loyalty program (think about all those people that get coupons/have loyalty rewards to the brand) along with the massive cash pile today and post-console sales to fundamentally change to an e-commerce model. Whether or not this ultimately works is unclear but it's definitely a different approach than Icahn's."
12002,Can we make James a mod please?
12003,Yeah. I’ve been looking at these today and I like that the decay happens faster. And 23 is a good entry point.
12004,Funniest part somehow is that the investors fucked it up because they had to release it this year. Still its going to be one of the best games soon when QQ is over
12005,Also in with 50 35c leaps. WFC selling their student loan portfolio before Biden forgives all the loans is fuckin brilliant btw
12006,"Download Webull asap, you can get buying power by tonight if you work fast."
12007,"This may actually be a good short-term and long-term play (as long as it's not taken private). Buy in now, cash out during the squeeze, and buy back in when the price comes back to earth (maybe $25-$30) for an 10 bagger over the next few years."
12008,"Ah yes, in this exhibit you will see the artwork known as ""The Mountain"". You can see the affection, excitement, love on the left leading up. But, at the peak, you can see the artists desperation and depression begin to be expressed as his brush strokes fall heavily downward. A true masterpiece."
12009,I think from Jan 2021 onwards it will have 20-40% upside potential. It's risky though. The downside potential is probably as large. I just think it will more likely go up than down from there.
12010,If your buying shares I’d say it’s fine to cost average in. I think we could take one more small trip south so I’d be weary of buying calls right now b/ theta and iv will wreck you if you buy now and we retest some level around 25 or 26. I’m holding shares but I’m waiting for 26 levels for calls or if we break 31.50 then I’m wrong and it’s likely breaking out so I’ll buy calls there. TLDR I’m buying calls at 25.50 (the pull back) or 31.50 (the breakout) whichever comes first.
12011,"Agreed, IYKYK. Here's my upvote.      You're not alone haha. It's going to go on my trading playlist when pltr hits 30."
12012,Swing traders are actually on swings?
12013,I'll keep throwing my money at whatever you guys want until I'm all out.
12014,I would have to sell to see the $. It has went down a bit since I posted. Still over $12k.
12015,You ain't getting a $2k stimulus check
12016,Seriously?  What other game are people even looking at buying right now?  Maybe the new Spiderman.  Everyone will be buying Cyberpunk in the coming months.
12017,TF? We are heading for a completely new dimension. $3500 is the target.
12018,"Bro, all the best to you! Hope it moons and then you can buy your old pal me a nice house"
12019,"They have two other subsidiaries that they recently purchased as well that reach a broader market. I’m on mobile at work so I don’t have time to dig up too much additional right now, but it’s my understanding that they are expanding their reach into more CTV space in addition to their ad search revenue. Ad tech gets a little complicated (I still honestly don’t know exactly what digital turbine does), but it’s been a very hot recovery play across all mediums, especially digital. You’re correct though that a big chunk of revenue (170 to 190 million annually last I checked) comes from Microsoft."
12020,That picture looks like an android with a semi chub having a neon piss.
12021,"It's ok my pltr brother...if you are long (dick), then you will see (men) at least $250 by 2023. If no market crash."

12023,"Bought shares and the PS4 game before launch. Lost \~$5k on the shares, and about 60 hours of my life in gameplay. Not sure what my time's worth these days, but conservatively significantly more aggregate value.  Current save file, the cyberware critical to my build won't activate.  When I take my V's pants off, I see her landing strip. Worth it."
12024,"Speculation, yes, but an interesting one.  It’s like the music business, streaming eats the physical copies.  I don’t think GME will be able to pull this off - this is more in the msft et al playground. BUT: access to really fast internet (for cheap) will be crucial.  And my guess is that there will first be consoles (read ‘phones’ of the future, VR) to access those cloud based games."
12025,"this will likely moon, because nothing makes sense...  but the types of games that would be big enough to create viable competitions already have the infrastructure that SKLZ is offering. So the market for their service isn't nearly as big as they claim"
12026,Cyberpunk is not only *Broken* its also *Incomplete*. They already pissed off loyal fans by explicitly stating that they wouldn't subject employees to crunch then they did it anyways. Now they have to do it even more and longer just to make the game decent on new gen and make it even playable on old gen. Thats gonna delay them even beginning to work on witcher 4 for years.  Basically this stock isn't gonna make you any money. Waste of time
12027,"You're being downvoted but you're 100% correct on this point (not in your main point though, Papa Cohen 4 Jesus.) The amount of times our family would get in the car, drive 2 towns over to the closest blockbuster, and find top 5 movies we wanted to rent or newest game out of stock was insane.   Blockbuster had the chance to have in-store burning of rentals to handle demand, but wouldn't invest in the licensing and equipment costs. Instead, Netflix had unlimited* inventory of every movie I didn't even know existed.   Brand recognition is a big advantage, people grew up with gamestop and probably have some good memories around games launching or playing demos in the store. Cohen can use that, Blockbuster only had the brand and store locations."
12028,Cohen is on board. This is no longer just a squeeze. This is a turn around company. I'M NOT SELLING.
12029,They want to keep it stuck below $22 because I heard that the ~$23 area is when they really start to bleed- once we break $23-$25 its straight to $40+
12030,"thank you for the encouragement, it's just ... sometimes it gets so long that I get a little confused."
12031,"Good overview, I think they will bounce back. Let’s not forget that the Cyberpunk franchise will likely expand too. It is full of bug now and they messed up but I think that the game itself is quite good"
12032,"I’ll take your word and but some January 52 dollar calls, but you have to give me my money back if it doesn’t work"
12033,F
12034,Most likely IV crush on the 21st followed by a non recovery in the price = certain death.
12035,"Congrats man! Quick question, when LGVW Changes to BFLY, is that going to be a 1-1 swap i.e. no change in value other than the name? I can't find any article on that."
12036,"Go with deep ITM puts coupled with a far out expiration, not your 600p weeklies, those will get you slaughtered. Yes, it is very expensive to buy TSLA options regardless of the direction"
12037,still better than most of the industry (I'm looking at you EA)
12038,"yeah hey if it works for you and its profitable great. just my 3 years of chart watching, ive realized, the less is better. like minimal is key for me. horizontal levels, maybe occasional fibs, and some VWAPs thats all there is to it. I think elliot wave can overcomplicate a new trader, and honestly, most people just flat out agree its bs. BUT you are right. to each their own."
12039,Now they just need to further limit (better yet: scale back entirely) the Accredited Investor Rule. Paternalistic and outdated; no need for it in the age of free-flowing information.
12040,If you're this confident go all in on Jan OTM calls then  There's a reason why people keep saying to buy shares nobody knows shit about when
12041,"Ha ha ha, what a story. I know its confidential because  I work at the Bank, but i'll tell you anyways. They say this too. Ha ha."
12042,"If you're betting on the short squeeze to happen, $50 is chump change. For real, $150 is within reach in such a scenario.  Otherwise, assuming short squeeze is not happening (I'm a half-believer in the MOASS, personally, but it's 2020, so nobody fucking knows anything any more), $30-60 would be the realistic target range, at this point."
12043,"Sorry if I’m missing something but how does this correlate at all with PLTR’s price? I get that it’s something of an emotional “win” for Theil and Karp but in what way does this affect the company at all?   This reads to me like you’re trying to force a correlation that doesn’t exist. Again, could be missing something, just wanna hear the thesis.   For the record I have calls"
12044,"2021 will tell.   If Cohen really takes over, I'm slowly beginning to think about a scenario where I DON'T sell this stock next year."

12047,"I invest in the Leaders/winners as much as their companies. The price is the effect, not the cause. You're chasing smoke and over analyze things."
12048,"I’m a big supporter of GILD and have been a bag holder from 60.40 2 days before last div. I rode the IMMU wave before being bought out by GILD. I think it might take a year or two for GILD to take off, but I do like it as a long hold(2-10yr) because of the drug line they bought from IMMU. They likely won’t get bought out as they just overpaid for a cancer treatment(paid 88 for a stock that was 9 in March, while their stock dropped from 80 to 60). I’d agree that it looks like it will stop it’s downturn soon, but I think 1/21 calls may be too soon. There’s still a chance this stock could hit 45ish(i will still be bag holding until $180). Cancer/biomedical stocks did amazing under Obama, and I’d expect something similar to happen under Biden(obamacare made cancer treatment affordable and paid for by insurance companies). Cancer treatment will go boom, boom, boom if we get Medicare for all, and should stay steady no matter what.        Food for thought: GILD bought a covid vaccine in the pipeline from IMMU being developed in S Korea(only reason I bought the IMMU stock in March), and if GILD can actually develop the vaccine and announce it, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it jump 20% in a day."
12049,See (1) above
12050,"this is a slow bleed actually, somewhat similar to what's happening with LMND right now. But, GME has much more steam, LMND doesn't have much higher to go imo."

If you want to see something interesting that makes a case for it not being compete BS, check out the chart of SW airlines ($LUV) from its genesis in the 1970s and plot your EW count. It’s such a perfect textbook example. Count is perfect and literally every fib level hits to a tee (you’ll want to look at fibs on log scale). I think the LUV chart somewhat disproves by example it being complete BS. Lastly, I think a lot of the EW stuff is more clear and concise when looking at forex and the virtual money we can’t talk about here."
12055,WBA 50c feb 19
12056,50?  I have half at 120 and the other half at 240.  I don't think 240 is realistic.  But 70-120 is imo if it really does squoze hard.  That said I have a tiny amount in this.  I'd probably be happy with 50 if I had more in it.
12057,&gt;I know its confidential  it ain't confidential when we all know it's true. LOL
12058,Trade the mid month options. Other weeks of the month are usually thinly traded and have huge spreads.  Jan 15th or Feb 19th. Sell a put or buy a call. I like the $60 Calls expiring Jan 15th.

12061,I’m not an oracle and didn’t intend to hijack OPs thread here but I see a wave 4 triangle that looks like it needs to make more subwave down to complete before the breakout. 25-26 seems like a reasonable level based on simple geometry.

12065,"Zero chance GILD falls to $45. The IMMU deal is now done.  The $26 billion in acquisitions that they did in 2020 is exactly the thesis a big pharma buyer  wants. GILD has barely started to realize cost synergies from all of the acquisitions that it has made. Big pharma is always see to be bigger.

If you lose 50% on a stock, you need a 100% gain to offset the loss. But if you hit 10% gains repeatedly, and do it 7 times in a row and you’ve make 100%. Don’t worry about how long it takes. Sometimes it takes longer than expected to make 10%. Sometimes it can be done quickly. GILD is going higher. When exactly — I don’t know. No one knows. By mid-January, probably. By this time next year, very likely."

12075,"It’s almost just as much the benefit of time as it is price. Buying calls when your chopping sideways is risky even if you know a breakout is imminent. The IV is so high on this thing that long dated calls are prohibitively expensive so I’ll be eyeing calls with about 30-45 DTE when I move in. The challenge is if you mistime a monthly you’ll just bleed out. Also, chopping sideways theoretically should calm the IV down relative to the VIX so presumably options get a little cheaper as sideways action consolidates all else being equal."

12077,"This might be a dumb question, but how exactly are MMs keeping the price down right now if PLTR is as good as you say? Shouldn’t retail and institutional alone be pumping it up by buying?"
12078,"Why so angry?  I did play on PS4 actually.  It’s janky yes but certainly far from unplayable’.  People who had no idea what to expect set their expectation too high and got burned, and investors panic sold.  Simple.  Also lots of people still love the game despite its issue.  Once it’s all patched up people will buy it up because most are just parroting the same bs you are and haven’t actually touched it."

12088,"The $26b in acquisitions was mainly overpaying on what they could’ve bought for 1/10 the price 6 months earlier. I’m not worried about the acquisition getting stalled(already completed). I’m worried about the stock issuances they’ve been doing, overpaying for something that every other company seems to be finding cures for, bloated corporate pay, and lack of divergence away from HIV and breast cancer.        As I said before, I am a bag holder and plan on holding long even if it goes down to $45 as it is part of my “retirement” portfolio. I just wanted people to know the bearish side so they can make better decisions about their entry point, and hopefully not panic sell if it does somehow dip to $45. A bear case isn’t always bad, and can be used to make better decisions."

It has helped an absolute fuck ton, people order delivery all the time now since theyre afraid of the big rona also alot of places are takeout only.  Especially during the first part of lockdown it was busy as fuck and people were tipping well.  Its the business itself and how they pay their dashers that sucks ass, also their retarded system has a crash during every busy period no joke.  So as far as making money the pandemic helped a fuck ton for doordash and the amount of orders went up for dashers therefore more money.  The business itself long term?  Shit.  Unless they change alot."

I get Theil was with him in the beginning and clearly knows how to make money, but he hasn’t come anywhere near proving himself as someone who can drive stock prices by personality alone like Elon has.

I am just helping the weak hand find the resolve to start a position here where your money is safest. I won't touch that GME pos or most of these insane options plays.   The Dumb Money will buy shares at $35 to $40. Look at the EV sector. The amazing part of that is it will work every time.   Tesla valuations has warped the perception of what value is. I can't buy those shares.   What exactly does PLtR shares have to prove for people to recognize its value? With strong revenue growth that will surprise without a doubt next quarter.   Shorting it is not going to work from here onwards without confirmed reasons. The FUD has been played out and CNBC is beginning to praise it.   In the end its up to you. I'm trying to help.

12148,"A SPAC is a company with a bunch of cash and nothing else, looking for a private company to buy a piece of and take public. No options, since they don't actually do anything or make any money so the price tends to stay about the same (a SPAC is worth the amount of cash it has, plus a bit extra if the people running it are well regarded or if there's (a rumor of) a deal).  Once the people running the SPAC find a company they like and make a deal to buy part of it, the SPAC and the other company merge and take the name of the other company (in this case Colonnade Acquisition will change their name to Ouster, assuming the deal gets completed). A few days later options become available on the renamed company."
12149,"I mean, what do you think PLTR and GME are?"

12233,"I buy them when they are slightly ITM. I don't buy deep ITM calls unless they are very close to break even.  Mostly I do that for REITs because I plan on holding them until close to expiry.  Examples of that are things like MFA where a $2 2023 call is $2.05 so I have 2 years for it to go up 5 cents for pure profit. It's basically immune to theta.   For PLTR the 2022 $22 call is the spicy one because it's only $1,200 and half of that is intrinsic value already. Meaning I'm only really paying $600 as the gamble and I can make that money back by selling 4 weekly calls for $1.50 each.   That's 52 weeks to pick 4 times where it's obvious that the week started crazy high and week end lower. If you pick 5 or more weeks out of the year where it does that then you made bonus money on top of its gains.   I would expect that single call to get me $5,600 at expiry and pull in another $1,800 from covered calls during easy plays.  Meaning, I paid $1,200, gambled $600 and pulled in $7,400. Total for waiting patiently is $6,200 in gains per contract initially bought."
12234,It better!  My 6100 shares are ready to get rock hard.
12235,"You can also pm me your IG name I can just send it there, if you can’t save it from here"
12236,I believe so. The original $10 price had an enterprise value of $1.5B.
12237,Did he also say you talk like a fagh and your shits is all retarded?
12238,Basically provides a platform for any mobile game to play against other people for money..
12239,Excellent thank you. This will hit 100 dollars a share à la KCAC/QS. Which calls would you recommend to supplement my significant share holdings?
12240,Because they're coocoo for cocoa puffs
12241,"I’m hoping for $100+.   Projections I’ve seen indicates 4x revenue growth in 2022. It’s a long term hold. If you’re not going to buy shares, you’ll need leaps. I don’t see this being like a KCAC QS equivalent. The EV sector is just on fire and kinda boggles the mind."
12242,"If it squeezes then that would be really dumb, cause the price will temporarily skyrocket way higher than it will settle back to. You should sell at some outrageous number and then buy back in once the dust settles."
12243,This isn't available on the retard exchanges I use (RH and WB) where is this available? Do I have to sign for Etrade or some shit?
12244,So nazis were onto something...  They predicted people’s sexuality!
12245,Can you short on robinhood? If so how?
12246,It does. But the lighting is usually a lot darker.
12247,I can’t tell if you’re serious or not.
12248,Modern lambos are a lot more reliable than lambos of the past. You can always buy a lambo and have a cheap corolla or some shit in case the lambo is in the shop.
12249,"No.  You can play the last gen version on the new systems, but they have confirmed that they will release a proper next gen version in 2021.  Might be delayed to 2022 though is what I'm thinking, given all the work they have to do on Cyberpunk.  Nevertheless, it will sell like hotcakes when released.  Long CDPRR is the play."
12250,After I saw this I went on robinhood drunk as hell and placed an order for this exact same call and before I was thinking is this the best way to spend 500$ then suddenly a GameStop commercially came on the tv and I placed the fucking order
12251,Dude... Give yourself some time. It's holiday season. 1/15? Really?
12252,Your example doesn’t make sense.  Why would you buy a deep ITM call on a reit and miss the dividend especially when the cost of your leap is essentially the same as buying shares?
12253,"Well of course I'll sell if it squeezes, but that's still unlikely. I like this slower burn right now, every day it goes up 1-3$"
12254,"Statistically speaking, I don’t see it going much below, $0."
12255,"Currently they only have a dividend of $0.01 per quarter. That means I'm only missing out on $8 at current rate. Until there is change to the dividend, they don't matter to me. I'm expecting an economic relief package for REITs in the early months   of 2021 which should trigger a serious rotation and price spike."
12256,Great answer.  Didn’t think of IV. I appreciate the insight
12257,I can't watch anything with Cordon. What a stupid fat pussy
12258,"Cyberpunk will have a free update, but the Witcher 3 sounded like it would be a high scale remake/upgrade so I doubt that will be free.  Given the shortage of high quality next gen titles atm, everyone will buy it."
12259,Klarman is the reason I'm in  That dude is an OG  value investor and if he thinks this is good it'sgotta  be good
12260,So.. this is what all of you look like in real life..
12261,"If I had any more money, I'd 100% put it in this. This is the ultimate moon, a mature unicorn at current price is insanely good value.  Already in a small position @26.06 a few weeks back."
12262,The MMs who are trying to figure out when they should buy in.

12264,All I want for Christmas is an almighty short squeeze
12265,I grabbed mine after the first dip a little under $31. I could not let go of it based on my thesis. Opportunity lost in a lottery stock is far more painful that losing 50%. Imagine you owned MSFT or the original DELL shares from the 90s. 11000% and you locked in 300%
12266,Getting it dude
12267,You guys are morons.  You put your money in here then you deserve to lose it.   It’s been a company since 2010.  Won’t have a product for sale till 2024.   14 years?  How long did Tesla’s battery take to develop?  Would not be surprised if this company doesn’t exist in 5 years.

12307,in all seriousness....i keep my money in the market....and i save a lot of money from my paychecks and it just goes straight to the market.  around 2-3k a week. discipline. not very WSB of me.

12312,I respect your attempt at a pump but this filing is 2 days old...
12313,It's okay the money printer will just print more money
12314,"The thing is, if there were no splits of bulls and bears we’d be literally unstoppable. The thing about WSB is there’s people who tag along and get tendies, the people who get in but a little too late, and the people that sit here to feed off the ones who got in late. People use WSB specifically for shorting. If everyone was synchronized and just dumped together then we’d be true market manipulators but you’ll always have that split, more often than not I find that anything pumped on WSB gets equally as discredited. Not to say people don’t make lots of money from WSB, personally I am bullish and buy where I can, but only calls but I know the bears who short our calls also have gains too. We all win but if we had complete coexistence we’d probably all be trillionaires or arrested."
12315,dude don't fuck with my emotions making me think cohen invested even more... this is old... FUCK.  :(
12316,Is this when he increased his holding from 9.8% to 13% (don’t rmbr exact numbers) or a different purchase?

12330,"literally bought into my first one, TAN, about a week ago and im already up so much. I am worried about a potential IV crush though."
12331,Well now I know why my Wendy’s order took so long
12332,I literally don’t understand what the hell this is supposed to mean
12333,Yeeeyeee get u a XboxNew
12334,I have 1 GTC limit order at ~$100 per share for a small portion of my position - only to recover the cost basis. The rest is 💎👐
12335,Honestly in 2 months I went from laughing at these retards while I had my 5% YTD boomer portfolio with my dividends. Now I'm just picking up stocks based on this sub and I'm not giving a shit about PE or dividends and am up 10% in a month. Only wish I found this place sooner. Next step is options then I can be a true autistic retard.
12336,When are earnings
12337,This is a joke sub and we need jokes. Not this real shit.
12338,"Careful, it’s a very very deep rabbit hole"
12339,Close the Options now mate. They’re cooked and ready.
12340,The pathway to YOLO gains is paved with countless bodies of those who lost all their savings to options.
12341,You’re retarded. In the not fun way.
12342,*We're going on a bear hunt*
12343,Bought at 16.80 it tanked to 12 so yesterday I was like yes I’ll take 17.80 and buy back when it tanks again.
12344,Gay bear are all naked!
12345,&gt;Destroy Earnings 1/7  &gt;distributing VAX all year.  All good news.  I'm buying puts.
12346,Yes I do agree. I do still research the Memes but its very hard to argue against the logic behind MT and GME. I am attempting to do as much research into options before making the jump. I understand how some people can get a little too caught up in the flash of this sub and a misleading promise of like 1000% gains. But for someone that's fairly young I am loving these more so high risk growth stocks. I do still have a decent % of my portfolio in some boomer stocks as a fail safe too.
12347,"50$? Those are rookie numbers tbh. Without the squeeze with a substantially lower float than before the price could easily hit 60-80 bucks per share and the company would still be worth less than previuos console cycles. Add Ryan Cohen to the equation and the value is almost impossible to predict. The longer the shorts wait, the more pain they will feel, this is a done deal at this point:)"
12348,Ain’t gonna happen. You’re only hope is the short squeeze theory which is unlikely to hold up.   I’m 35 years into being a diehard gamer and have worked in the industry for 15 years. GameStop has to pivot hard into a new sector of the gaming business to get back to their previous levels. They don’t hold the weight with the gaming community anymore and there are plenty of players coming in with better holds on the game sales market. They have to completely change to be a meaningful company again.
12349,All are welcome except for Cramer’s bitch ass because he sold out before the internet and wants you to buy and hold boomer faves like P&amp;G and Campbells Soup 🤮 🤮 🤮
12350,So you have a 35 year old neck beard? 🌈🐻
12351,"Hey, I heard you're a FUPA fanatic! Come checkout r/FUPAlert!"
12352,I'm up 60% since I started and 3200% from a month ago.
12353,Have you met leaps?  Leaps on ARKK seem bullish af
12354,ICLN and QCLN ETFs are just money printers.
12355,"Still don't get it. As a gamer, game stop is my worst option to get a game."
12356,"When GME and MT make me a lot of money, I'll buy a Peloton"
12357,How the fuck can someone watch GME skyrocket and then after it rises $15 say now is a good time to enter long.
12358,"sir, do you know where you are?"
12359,Bears are about to get their blocks busted
12360,You need to grow a goatee and pony tail for options so you can tap into that BIG dick energy of the Najarian brothers if you want to do options
12361,And yet your best option to make money. Hows it feel sittin on the sidelines while we cash in a 10 bagger 🐻🌈
12362,"But it won’t be one day.  Alternatively, fuck off 🏳️‍🌈🐻"
12363,I am low key annoyed that PRPL wasn’t on the purple side of the pill.
12364,That’s what you get for using the f word
12365,you're going to be sorely disappointed once we start hitting 45+
12366,Where are you? Wouldn’t be the worst option to get a game but it’s the only game shop working shopping centres in Ireland. Loads of people go to a toy shop called Smyths for games it’s far better for consoles and accessories but they are located in retail parks.  Anyway.. I was in game last week and someone came in to ask for some accessory I don’t know what it was.. they said they didn’t have it.. the guy goes “so just games and headphones left then?” And the employee said “yes” The demand is there.. there is no supply. If they had PS5’s and other stock they’d clean up..  the stores can be small as well very little room for much

12386,"honestly I looked on average 5days out of the week and looked at $PLTR almost 1500times since debut. All see is festive greens and reds, it's not even the money anymore just colors."
12387,Are you cured?   You might be one of those werebears.  But congrats and good luck!
12388,P A L A N R I T
12389,"What stops you from taking the best of both worlds?  I sell puts ATM for high premiums and get assigned. I took on 900 shares of GME this way. What's better than buying shares? Getting paid to buy shares.  Now I'm riding this green dildo to the top. Bought some calls too.   Good DD is good DD. If you read a DD and do your own and think it's a solid play, buy and sell the options you need to buy and sell to make some fucking money. Don't force yourself to pick one or the other."
12390,in feb-mar metals crashed along with the rest of the market
12391,Gamestop really isn't for gamers per say. It is moving toward an online platform for e-commerce. Think normies buying gifts.
12392,"I'm bullish on PLTR, but ATH today seems a little optimistic."
12393,This is so gay. I love it
12394,Most of these retards are just selling because they don’t understand what a short squeeze is and they are scared
12395,"I’m saving up for a beamer, LOL just kidding, because of this app I actually have to sell mine..."
12396,"I thought pigs eat well, and hogs get slaughtered?"
12397,Dude if it hits 30 alone I'll be at peace.
12398,If this group had any power then GME would have rocketed a while ago. We are just actually pretty good at finding things before they take off. We don’t drive the takeoff. Had to downvote you for promoting inaccuracy.  $GME to the moon. Buy some and shut up
12399,Roku won't make you broku
12400,2 months!?!?  It took me two days to convert!! I’ll live to regret it I’m sure but I’m in too deep now.
12401,You want a referral code? 👀
12402,So you have chosen death
12403,That's a lot of words and no positions. Ban.
12404,Wish I would have cashed my Lightroom &amp; bought that 100 @ 15
12405,agreed - this is de way
12406,Using rational will not make you money as you're thinking like everyone else.
12407,"Gold and silver spike in recessions, not crash. Investing in gold and silver is a put against the US economy."
12408,I'd say the odds of you being a CNCB analyst within the next six months has risen to 70%
12409,This is it boys. Strap on in.
12410,Diamond hand everyday kill all gay bear!
12411,"GME doesn’t have a long term plan that can sustain this short term growth. Don’t stay in too long! (Others will downvote me because if you sell it don’t help them, but you could eventually get left in the cold) well done tard!"
12412,Wish I wasn't such a bitch about converting like you lol. Would have been into PLTR at under $10 cost basis.
12413,Sold a few for about an 8k profit already. holding these until close today because I know you guys have paper hands.
12414,That's a vibrator
12415,Bro how are you guys making money like this lol
12416,We all start somewhere buddy  gains are gains
12417,My DD is as follows:  I haven't seen any roku makes me broku posts. This means that roku is in fact making us rich.
12418,just when I thought wsb hit peak retard
12419,"Yeah I’m fucking amazed. When my boomer uncle tried to get me into investing, I was uninterested and didn’t understand it. But the lingo of WSB really helps my smooth brain to understand. How many 🚀’s? Okay, I’m in. All of my positions are green right now thanks to you fucks and I still have no idea what I’m doing. WSB forever"
12420,Well alright then congrats but fuck you
12421,Very nice bro!!! Magnite has been a Christmas miracle so far for me too
12422,All diamond hands on deck! 🚀
12423,"""it lets them focus on the Nikola 2 and Tre"""
12424,MGNI was the Christmas present I didn’t ask for
12425,"I freaked the fuck out and let my emotions get the better of me on this mornings dip and pulled my calls out, making good gains. But realized I was retarded for doing so, so I’m back in baby.  $23c 1/8 ;)"
12426,"Check, and we're a go for launch"
12427,"I'm almost always a bull with the WSB gang, but this one is close to home. Just trying to help. If I am wrong then big congrats to everyone."
12428,I was 1/2 way to retarded before I even found this group so it was an easy decision
12429,At this point this sub is high on jet fuel and cocaine because we've been to the moon so many times.
12430,"That's a vibrator box, right?"
12431,"I like the song but it’s too r/invest. I was expecting you to come up with more wsb meme! Did I miss something or was there no mention of YOLO, my wife’s bf, any meme stock, retardness, xx to the moon, daddy musk, tendies? How long have you really been here!"
12432,"For reference, im up 1200% on my 15.5 option for this week. You should be patient. There will be a squeeze at the end of the week."
12433,"i'm seeing another sideways trade day, i think we'll see it pop right before early close tomorrow. hoping for PLRT xmas bonus tomorrow"
12434,"K&amp;G, and Cathy is bae"
12435,"GLD,gc,and xau are better."
12436,I'm doing well too. It was one of the first options I bought.
12437,Someone please come up with a song inspired by Desiigner - Panda and have “tendies” said instead of Panda or something
12438,I don't get the industry hatred towards GME. You gamers are an odd bunch.  You all actively hate GME and the second someone walks in the door to try and improve the business and customer experience everyone wants to see it fail. Makes no sense.  Position: long thousands of shares since $6
12439,"I had 12/18 , 20c, made 30%. Same play in jan, would have been 1000% now. damn"
12440,"5 years ago GME traded at $30 and since then the've closed half their stores and revenue has plummeted so yeah why not 500c 1/15, makes total sense"
12441,no they are not.  $GOLD has free cash flow of 1.1 billion at copper 3.00.  Copper @ 3.50 and higher will give them FCF around 1.5 Billion this quarter.
12442,"It's *per se, btw."
12443,"Up 8k as well, great stock"
12444,"K&amp;G, that’s enough for me  We got the same ban flair lol"
12445,"palantir will fly because it drinks red bull.   but no seriously, Indicators are literal garbage."
12446,If it hits $35 today I’ll Venmo you $500 but we all know that shit ain’t happening

12450,Fuck it. I’m in. Only enough cash for 4 shares but what the hell
12451,It varies. I personally used to go to GameStop all the time. I still go into the store periodically. The big thing with GameStop in my opinion unrelated to the stock is that used/older game are much cheaper than buying digital and easily accessible as I have one a few blocks away
12452,Sellers today are going to regret
12453,"Do people really think that gamestop is not a dogshit company? Just take your gains and dip, gamestop has almost no chance in the market. It's fucking boomer-tier."
12454,"We're getting ready for take off and paper hands are like, yeah that's cool, but I can go on a trip the the space museum instead"
12455,they lose it a week later and don't post the loss. simple
12456,"They really boned gamers for years. Their buyback program took advantage of mostly young people having to sell their stuff for much less than what it was worth then they would mark it back up on favorable margins for resale. On top of that, their Power Rewards program was just a ploy to get your personal information so they could leverage that far beyond marketing. It was pretty lame to be honest. I’m actually hoping their new management can turn it into something worth cheering for."
12457,Yea it’s the date 20/12/15 how long it was (2 days) and how many times you’ve gotten the ban (1)
12458,Only $400? Found the bear! $1337 is a conservatives estimate.
12459,I don't understand why its jumping 15% today but I'm glad I got on the 🚀
12460,"Agreed. Lately i'm conservatively building up my retard level here, which I didn't expect too. But fuk"
12461,Wtf does this mean? Just calls way out? Like 12+ months? Is that a leap?
12462,Congrats!   I've been wondering where all the MGNI posts are. I got super lucky last week with that Friday surge. Then I rolled over to 1/15 at 25 and I'm liking the results so far. [insert rocket emoji here]
12463,My GME positions are finally not negative. Sweet
12464,no timeframe and can't even give the proper ticker... well done
12465,"Is there a quick way to learn about ETFs with all the info right there? If not I'll research it like calls, but I had to wear 2 helmets when I did that"
12466,I know the GME story very well. GME of the past does not really exist anymore. That's what Cohen is here for. Support the guy. Let him build a great gaming retailer. Buy shares and vote for him when he tries to remove the board in a few months.  But gambling on 1.5dte puts and making money doesn't prove a thesis. Both calls and puts are up today if you bought the right strike at the right time.
12467,Hedgeye’s research = reading WSB DD and slapping a -90% price target.   $420 or bust.
12468,We might see more aggressive squeeze end of day. No repo to cover short available today -&gt; https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME
12469,Plenty of people still buy new/used physical games both in-person and online.  Games are just going to go away.
12470,"Look, I’m with you. I’ll be supportive at the right price. It’s just not at this level. I would love to see them be successful and you are absolutely right when it comes to their board. Those guys are fucking clueless."
12471,"“Hydrogen refueling is the real play, the trucks are just to build a market.”"
12472,Is that a picture of a rocket ship on that box that he's holding or it's just his new vibrator? Regardless it looks so gay (tes).
12473,If it hits 420 there wont be or. I will bust dude
12474,LOVE TO SEE IT!
12475,If I had his money I'd get a boob job just for fun
12476,I already yolo'd everything into it - I just got paid................ Imma do it again...................
12477,"If this sub does own 5% of GME shares, you got to wonder if it really doesn't have moving power. Maybe GME would be much lower if it weren't for this sub."
12478,I dont care if  it looks like Richard Simmons butt buster Bill
12479,"Want to know what’s better? Any time you look at Citron’s Twitter, they are always praising Hedgeye."
12480,S/O to Cult. I want a pony.
12481,"It’s 2 days old and everyone here already knew that, but since it’s GME porn I can’t downvote you. Here’s some rockets for all of us 💎 🙌   🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to $1000"
12482,Yeah kind of... But they are both denominated in USD so gotta short deutsche marks as an intuitive hedge.
12483,"I have a friend who is 100% deep into the conspiracy stuff and he insists that Bill and Melinda are gender-swapped, as are most famous couples."
12484,QCLN has been crushing for me... and I can sleep at night
12485,I was holding January 2022 calls at $120 that I just rolled out to a $150 strike. I always like to keep my contracts that far out so time decay is never a huge factor. As a rule I never buy options that expire in less than 3 months. As far as my usually “leap play” goes I don’t technically buy long out enough for them to really be leaps. I try to look for options 9-12 months out with a plan to sell in 3 months to either reinvest in a new strike or pull profits entirely
12486,next sears k mart
12487,Cheap stock for them to keep averaging down. But they will ultimately loose all money. Can’t wait for SEC to delist this trash company and end this shinanigan.
12488,"You guys do know Amazon, aka the destroyer of companies, just decided to go after the pharmaceutical market?  I bet Jeff B email signature says:  Respectfully F*** Walgreens, Jeffery B"
12489,At least spell it right to hide your retardation
12490,#Dr. PP has spoken
12491,"I saved my portfolio by buying LEAP options on margin* on a mundane utility ETF.   ETFs are actually the best way to take huge risks, as they isolate you from the idiosyncratic risks of a single company, reducing risk considerably.   *I know you can’t technically buy options on margin, but I had enough stocks as collateral that I was able to use Robinhood gold to buy options"
12492,Sorry it was EOD price target
12493,It rhymes so it checks out
12494,I always upvote an autist who knows they’re a retard.
12495,never thought i’d see les mis on here  goat play tho
12496,He does and was giving a compliment
12497,"Just work at wendys for a year and use all of that money to buy 11k shares, but by then $gme will be $500 per share, so you better start earning money now"
12498,"Im with you, but these kids just look at the stock side .  In its current state, gamestop will be die.  More and more people get them from Walmart , Amazon or directly download to their consoles.  You can only sell used consoles and funko pops for so long before the doors close.   Its only a matter of time."
12499,I can't afford them anymore. I need a few paychecks after I blew up my account
12500,You have enough disposable income to drop 100k+ per year into the market from your paychecks? So you’re making 250k+ and you spend your time here?  Respect
12501,About what I make in a year working my 40 hours a week. Do some good with the money and be happy.
12502,ZOOM all over again
12503,Nah they are gonna end up pumping the shit out of some penny stock and its gonna fly 3000% in one day.
12504,We're going to catch a big one!
12505,ARKF and MSOS are two ETFs on the cheaper end you could look into. I have a position in both of them right now
12506,Who needs DD when ARK has your back.
12507,"Fuck you're late bud, this news was out 5 minutes after the SEC published it. Fuckin 8:05 Monday morning we were all jerking off to it."
12508,The hogs are the short sellers that borrow as many shares as they can to drive the price down.
12509,"Yolo means everything you have, so yes in your case"
12510,Some of the boomer stocks 🚀🚀🚀 though. I bought CLX shares for my wife's IRA last year before Covid and that exploded
12511,"Thanks for the info!  I'm currently into a bit of margin so that I could finish loading on PLTR for long-term holding, but when I've paid that down, I'll try your method with one or two contracts and see how that works out... Probably after the expected market pullback in 2021."
12512,There’s always a retard who doesn’t understand the play.
12513,I don’t think I have enough upvotes for all these GME comments and posts 🚀🚀🚀
12514,"The difference between those stocks and our stocks is that those stocks go boom on fundamentals and other tea-leaf-reading market voodoo BS. Our stocks go Boom because we’re retarded and by and large, buy up these options indiscriminately. Some of these companies and trends are legit, others not so much but autistic people only care about the $$ and this lifestyle."
12515,I love seeing Nikola fail and the scammer Trevor getting burned.... I will sleep well tonight
12516,yes. wife and i hit the $300k combined and i literally do take advice from WSB. there are some smart ppl here.   and tip for the paper handed fucks.  if someone here proves they have a fucking MILLION dollars in a position....you might want to tail them.  there are TWO of them here! get your money in
12517,And this is where I disagree with you about trading at this level. Look at the market cap of GME. Is 1.4bn fair? You think that is overvalued? They do 1.4bn annually in e-commerce sales which make up ~20% of revenue. If this was a standalone e-commerce company with 1.4bn in sales it would have a 2-5x multiple. GME is massively undervalued here and will continue to rerate as the bankruptcy threat is now zero. No reason this doesn't trade at 3bn market cap moving forward and even higher under Cohen's control. Makes no sense to be trading at $20. Should be $40+
12518,It only goes up
12519,"Its honestly the memes. I am a real life genius turned fully autistic. I buy stuff that has good letters, and only feel happy from the color green and watching my wife get banged"
12520,"&gt;Ain’t gonna happen  Famous last words. Everything you have said would hold true, except Ryan Cohen changes the equation completely. He isn't increasing his stake in the company and hiring lawyers experienced in proxy battles and shareholder activism just for funsies."
12521,"A dude can't be one week out of Reddit without losing a great fucking play! Buying at 20, just fuck it 🚀🚀🚀"
12522,"MGNI, PERI, FL(N)T absolutely soaring and carrying my account today. Check out those last two if you want some very similar runners. This is a hot sector right now."
12523,I saw this and thought wtf is bill selling vibrators for and came here looking to see if someone could shed light on what it is but I guess ya its just a vibrator.
12524,"They are doing that revenue now, yes. However, the entire industry is shifting toward publishers creating their own digital download marketplaces for their own games and cutting out the middle men. See Epic Games Store, Activision Blizzard’s Battlenet, Riot Games free to play MTX model, EA Origin etc. All of those are being iterated upon and most of the sales platforms are recent. Even STEAM will lose a little ground because publishers will create their own sales platforms and or move to free to play/MTX model completely. Publishers won’t need GameStop and it is in their best interest to cut them out altogether."
12525,"Fuck, now I gotta sell PTON if wsb is interested"
12526,"Except multiple vendors, like MSFT, actively support GME and want it to thrive. They have been open about these statements.   All your issues with GME are software related. That is one dimension of their multi-dimensional business model."
12527,"IV crush on an ETF isn't really a thing because it's made up of a bunch of stocks. Dividend risk is real, though, but on a LEAP as long as it keeps going up it won't really matter too much."
12528,"Yup, my IWM leaps I bought earlier this year are killing it!"
12529,"Dr. Patel, as a humble disciple I might have a suggestion. Why not just buy both?"
12530,"MSFT is basically wiping GME’s ass for them right now because they have been the primary distributor of their consoles. I will admit the GME deal with MSFT to piggy back off digital download revenue is nice, but I want to see the revenue results first. I’m not sure that is enough to prop up this valuation and eventually, it will be in MSFT’s interest to cut them out."
12531,It's no longer just two of them anymore. It's at least half a dozen now LOL.
12532,What GME calls would be a good purchase before today's market close?
12533,"it’s a low cost portable ultrasound created by butterfly networks, they even sell one for pets too"
12534,"I’m in GME with a large portion of my portfolio, but honestly people will start taking profits around 45. The idea that wallstreetbets is going to be organizers enough to not sell when people start seeing 5x off of stock is way too out there, even for this sub."
12535,"I'm an outsider as well, not even from the USA, making around 300 dollars a month from my internship but really wanting to YOLO some of it monthly LMAO stop tempting me"
12536,Only $1337? God you are 🌈🌈🌈.  I'll sell at $2000.
12537,I called TDA you could still short it for 20% fee annually. So it is just his scrapper that is fcked.
12538,Yeah they just seem so expensive. Not sure what IV means. I’ll have to look into that
12539,At $23 sir jack is officially a multimillionaire
12540,I buy all my games off the PlayStation store anymore. I’m not sure how they’ll manage being the middle man between developers and system providers
12541,I’m going all in this. Should I dump my check money in?
12542,It’s breaking out
12543,PTON sells an exercise bike with an ipad attached to it.
12544,&gt;Yeah they just seem so expensive. Not sure what IV means. I’ll have to look into that  implied volatility

12551,A call a day keeps the  🏳️‍🌈🐻 away
12552,"I was a doubter at first too. Because of all the loss porn and figured that was the norm, but there is some solid DD here and sometimes it’s downright prophetic in here. I opened my Robinhood 4 weeks ago and I’m up 1k.  GME 🚀🌙"
12553,"if you're conservative, next weeks 22/23 spread is .27, meaning a near 4-bagger as long as they close at or above 23, which seems retardedly easy.  if you've got balls, even fuck that, 25-30 spreads are .60, ridiculous"
12554,What does he mean by “burn the longs on BBY” are they bearish on it? I cant find anything on their twitter.
12555,So you bought calls of ark when it was 120 with a strike of 150? and so long as ark is going up you're constantly profiting? sorry just trying to learn options right now.
12556,I sold my 1/15 20c for $400 profit. I could have been sitting on 3k rn fuck my life. Thats ok though I've had a few winners this year that I didnt throw more money at but its all a learning experience. At least I'm young :)
12557,"Nice! Shares or calls? All in I’m over 450k deep on GME, 100% diamond hands to the moon let’s go 🚀🚀🚀"
12558,You’re holding 10% and 20% of the total OI of those contracts. I hope you’re right.   IV is still low too. Good dividend. Shares or LEAPs might not be a bad play either.
12559,Ohhh shit.  Jon Najarian is on the GME Feb $22 calls train.  LETS FUCKING GOOOO!   Big dick &amp; pony tail just flapping in the wind as we 🚀🚀🚀🛸🛸🛸
12560,"Unless Ryan Cohen has a guaranteed, fool-proof way to get high search result rankings for any product he so chooses, there is nothing he can do here.  Honestly, his pivot plan is not that great. Just because you have an eCommerce presence alone does not mean people are just going to buy from you. His strategy letter is no different from some standard McKinsey output that any brick and mortar retailer might get if they paid those guys $500k.   What GameStop should actually do is become a game publisher themselves. Since they apparently have all of the expertise of gamers and what gamers like and the list of 55 million gamers and the attention of influential media in the gaming space, they should make games and try to sell them through that pre-existing distribution channel. Netflix is only still around because they began publishing their own exclusive content. If they were not producing original material, competition would have long since eaten up their first mover advantage."
12561,Seeing some odd behavior today in volume.  Hedges are definitely pulling out any tricks they can think of.  I have no doubt that iborrow not updating is part of this.  They are likely trying to hide short covering anyway they can.
12562,2k? WEAK! Why not try to make a profit?  $42069 or bust.
12563,"My guy, just do the exact opposite of what your emotions tell you to do. When you’re scared or desperate, buy. When you’re euphoric and overconfident, sell.   And for Gme you’ve got to realize that this is going to be a wild ride for a while, so you’ve got to just commit to diamond handing from the get go. No selling, only buying the dips."

12566,It's actually a Butterfly IQ ultrasound device. It has a lightning bolt cable that plugs into iPads for easy mobile ultrasounds.
12567,But I only have $.50 and a third grade education.
12568,Why is everyone on here a crybaby towards realists?
12569,"This seems like a lot of confidence for a company that most recently grew only 12% year over year.  I know the headline ran with 62% growth and some of the financial sites show that 62% as well. But from their own quarterly press release, that is not the actual growth rate.   Magnite revenue was $61.0 million for Q3 2020, up 62% from Q3 2019 on an as reported basis and up 12% on a pro-forma basis  Third quarter 2020 financial results of Magnite represent the combined performance of Rubicon Project and Telaria, which merged on April 1, 2020. Third quarter 2019 comparative numbers do not include results from Telaria, unless noted as pro-forma.  Telaria was around a $15M/quarter company. So the 62% doesn’t take into account nearly 25% of the combined company total revenue into the comparable. And when you look at the comparable it’s only 12% growth for the combined company.   Further the mobile and desktop grew about 3% YoY. And CTV accounted for $11M and 18% of revenue and grew at 51%. At $11M that should be growing near triple digits to be anywhere near matching the narrative. $11M and 51% are pathetically small numbers for what should be a hypergrowth market. And that CTV growth rate has fallen like a rock every quarter.  The guidance is similarly weak at $75M at top of guide. The Q4 combined comparable is $68.1M, implying 10-11% growth. Q4 is a seasonally larger quarter for both of the Magnite companies. As typical you can expect Q1 guide to show a decline QoQ. And probably continued 10-12% growth.  There are far better companies to invest in this space."
12570,"You son of a bitch, I'm in."
12571,You’re seriously calling yourself a realist?  The whole point of the GME play is the hope that RC will CREATE a long term plan for GME.
12572,Joined 3 weeks ago. All in 700 shares into GME 17.70. LET'S GO  🚀🚀🚀
12573,"Nobody here realizes that Gamestop's share jump is because of a new-gen console release and not because some dude bought shares. Every decision the board has made in the past 10 years is to the detriment of the bottom line: Cricket, mobile devices, credit card, and trying to publish games. They're the middle-man that's being cut out because of digital. They've shifted away from their business model, the Circle of Life, and wonder why they're bleeding cash reserves. But fuck it, let's buy 10,000 shares!"
12574,IB's are gonna rip your assholes before year end lol. God speed GME hodlers.
12575,How hard will my GME $25c 1/8 print? Please somebody confirm I will see a 5 bagger or something after already blowing up my account this year 🤡
12576,And what do you think that will be? They haven’t presented anything even close to tangible. Everything is going digital. The only reason GME is going up right now is because of the holidays.
12577,"Can you ever really get screwed that hard selling a covered call? You're capping your upside, but there's not all that much risk beyond that. Or am I a retard?"
12578,"Not sure if this is wise or stupid, but I find it funny because      where were you in Dec 2018 when ROKU was sub $29???"
12579,"MGNI shares right now (cashed out my January calls, might jump in with new options), PERI April 10c (and shares), F L N T March 5c (loading shares on dips)."
12580,Lol you really don’t get it.  Yeah they haven’t presented a long term plan yet.  THAT IS FOT COHEN TO DO.  Cohen is the play.
12581,apple is EV. PTON's bike has wheels so also EV
12582,"No such thing as late, only not at all."
12583,"So, based on what you told me, I should be selling GME.  NO  FUCKING  WAY  Once this goes 3x for me, I'll sell my seed capital. After that, I'll be looking at that sweet sweet 5x and praying to Lord Cohen for a 10x."
12584,"The problem is that there's a push for digital from both Sony and Microsoft. It is just better for them to sell digital and start charging for extra space on consoles.   PC market is also heavily reliant on Steam and online sales. For the people that would buy used games to save money on PC, they can just go the extra step and pirate.   There is no future in used physical copies of games and the only reason it hasn't already died out yet is because of collectors that pay $100+ for same game.   Games aren't going to go away but gamestop will. Pretty sure it will just be another radioshack.   This gme evaluation is like when Elon fans say Tesla will hit 2000 after battery day. Like we just developed alien tech and the news will make everything skyrocket.   Holding on to a hope that gamestop will change everything that's wrong with it and become a massive online retailer. Like... why would anyone buy from gamestop when they can get it for the same price and better guarantees from Amazon?"
12585,"all in with 19 shares, holding until my coal heart turns to diamond hands"
12586,"And they offer shared experiences and shit. I think it’s something about fatties motivating each other through social something something.   If spending all that money on this bike doesn’t motivate you, nothing will.    Once the plague is over, everybody’s back to the gym."
12587,"Bought at 13.3 during the recent post q3 earnings dip, sold at 13.85, thinking it will dip lower again and I'm gonna nab a few more shares for the same price.  Well, it gapped up to $14+ the next day, I didn't buy, it gapped up to $15+ the day after, so I was forced to buy in at $15.4 and owning less shares for more money spent.  There's no timing this thing any more, the swings are way too violent and rapid, both up and down.  You pick your dip and stick with it. 💎🙌 is the only way."
12588,PTON sells an ipad with an exercise bike attached to it.
12589,"No I bought calls with a strike price of $120 2 weeks ago and I sold them this week, I still like the ETF and want a position so I put back about 70% into options at a new strike price of $150. The other 30% I plan on putting into shares of something, I haven’t really decided yet so it’s sitting in cash right now"
12590,"Yep, this is a stock to buy and hold until April at least. Call options if you wanna gamble, but stocks are still cheap enough."
12591,When LGVW changes to BFLY. Is this a 1-1 swap?
12592,"Owned some as a dollar hedge since printer BRRR. It's vastly underperformed the market, so hedge successful!  That said, next year I anticipate the opposite. Then again, it'll underperform the asset class we can't talk about at the same time."
12593,Losing my money on MU 90c
12594,"Good luck catching that dip, it's struggling to pull back below 21 now. I don't remember when was the last time we had 2 days of continuous, relentless GME rallying..."
12595,What's an IB? You have to spell it out for us retards.
12596,"So you’re just going to hope for Cohen to magically come up with a long term solution? I don’t see what I’m not getting. I’m not saying GME isn’t a decent play right now, but long term... I just don’t see it. GME is the next blockbuster if they can’t come up with something groundbreaking."
12597,"That's as retarded as WSB is known for. I'm bullish as fuck on GME and I think I will 3x my position by June 2021, all in on shares, but I would not gamble on $25 that early into 2021.  Stonk moves up on a weekly/monthly basis, but there are and probably will be some red days."
12598,Isn’t it better to hold the leaps for more than 1 year so you can get long term capital gains rate?
12599,Pretty sure it's AAPL that's very overvalued once you consider it's just a car company that hasn't yet sold any cars valued higher than any established car company. Next NKLA amirite?
12600,look all GME needs to do is say they are turning the B&amp;M stores into solar battery charger/storing tations
12601,You could but that means you'll have to hold for a year + also and most don't want to hold that long. I usually buy calls a year out and sell 9 months after.
12602,They go wee wee wee all the way home
12603,"I'm in already, don't even know at what price, but I'm up 5%!! 🚀  edit: Was up."
12604,Can you explain to me I shouldn't be buying GME right now (21 ish) and how limit selling at 50 isn't free money?
12605,"If you bought in at $15.40 then that would have been after Cohen's SEC filling, I don't see any downside from that price point."
12606,Underlying can drop and you can't sell your shares without repurchasing the call. It'll be cheaper to repurchase but you still need the capital to exit your position
12607,If you have 30 bucks yolo all in on P C P L warrants just do it
12608,"no ATH today bc a bunch of calls have to expire worthless tomorrow, but there is some bullish divergence on the daily and 4 hr RSI  and MACD crossover on 4hr so it looks promising"
12609,NKLA just got dumped by a garbage company.
12610,Buy GME. That is all
12611,"ETFs have dividends like regular companies. TAN's is currently $.13/share/year, or $.0339/share/quarter. What happens is on the day the dividend is paid out, the share price of the ETF goes down by the dividend amount. $.03 isn't a lot so I wouldn't worry about it. The risk would be if you've sold a put spread you could be looking at early assignment on the short put if you had something with a larger divided and you were right on the edge of being in the money."
12612,"I would agree with most of what you said, but again people still buy physical console games and not just for the collectors edition.  PC gaming aside, there will still be a market for psychical when we're talking about consoles games.  I'm not buying into gme, but I wouldn't expect physical games to die out in this generation of consoles. Amazon might have the lions share of the market but it didn't have all of it."
12613,I did the same with a few shares. smh
12614,"You guys are all pussies, I’m looking at the order book and someone’s has an order to sell 100 shares at $199,999 😆"
12615,Lol people upvoting a 26% gain? That's like the daily volatility of my portfolio
12616,Our gamestop in town is so so busy. If a parent or whoever wants to buy a gift for a gamer they know? Gamestop. There is literally no other competition in town or any other nearby towns other than gamestop! So I think that huge brand recognition will be a huge factor going forward into more of an online powerhouse
12617,"It's part of the plan. Don't let the shorts know.   If all they have is an online store, I wouldn't be interested."
12618,If you're covered correctly then the risks of getting screwed really hard are minimalized. However not all call sellers are smart and sell covered or smart calls.   There are those that YOLO their call sells or [are just stupid do their shit wrong.](https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ah578l/eli5_box_spreads_and_u1ronyman_50k_loss_on/)
12619,imagine selling when it can go to a 100
12620,Irritable bowels ain't ripping people with DIAMOND HANDS. TAKE THAT PAPER HANDS AND WIPE THY ASS
12621,So cultural
12622,Why not buy a leap that’s 2 years out &amp; sell it at 1 year out &amp; the rebuy still 2 years out again? You wouldn’t get almost any theta decay
12623,Ok so why isn't limit selling at 100 free money x 4?
12624,Yea you could do that also to play for the long con. I've got some pltr $50 calls for 2022.  The further out the more premium you pay but it's also safer.  It's all about what personal preference you prefer. Some want to make profits sooner and reinvest into something else faster.
12625,Ohh now I get it
12626,"My picks for gold mining were NEM, GOLD, and AU. I sold those off recently a bit ago. Maybe it’s time to pick them back up"
12627,"I bought last Friday (December 18), don't remember when exactly Cohen filed. But, my purchase came after watching the stock drilling through the $14-$15 range for 2 days straight. I just knew GME is already on the way out of the hole, so I locked in my price point and made peace with the fact I now own less shares for more money invested (made some short-term profits on GME and MRNA swings). It dipped a few times to 15.3 that day, so I pretty much bought at the bottom, and then just shot straight to stratosphere this week, as we all clearly know now."
12628,"Just SPY? I suggest my approach to picking other ETFs:  &amp;#x200B;  1) Open the list of IShares/state street/w.e etfs  2) sort by expense ratio  3) find an ETF with an amusing code (for ex, SPSM, which I pronounce 'spasm')  4) Buy   &amp;#x200B;  It works great\*  &amp;#x200B;  ^(\*during a bull market)"
12629,"In theory, then you do it and the stock explodes and you feel like an idiot looking at the thousands of dollars you would have made if you didn't sell that fucking call"
12630,"\^this, just hold and forget about the daily swings, this is now a rollercoaster ride. I stopped trying to swing trade it, it's way too volatile now to be predicted with any level of accuracy.  Over the next few weeks, don't be surprised if we see a big correction below the $20 mark at some point, followed by violent upswings into $23+ range.  One thing's for sure, we're hitting $30 in 2021, so if you have to delete the app until then to avoid being a paperhanded idiot, do it."
12631,I'd bet $0.5 that price was set by some WSB autist.

12634,"Where are the rockets? What is this bullshit? Here, I'll do it for you. GOLD 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
12635,I regret not putting more into this. I just wanted to start the position a couple days ago so I put in like 250$ options 250$  stock thinking it could go up or down and I was gunna add more. Now I’m up 500% on my options and could’ve had so much more lol
12636,Bought 2 call options with premium of $14.80 each on 12/18/2020 Strike is $110 Expiry is 01/21/2022  Any thoughts?  Edit: I should mention that both options are currently valued at $21.05 as of close today.
12637,"Thank you. And i am still pretty new to options in general, what do you think my biggest risk with having a naked LEAP call is with TAN?"
12638,MM's just shaking out the retards and paperhands. it'll blow right through again.
12639,Is your wife's boyfriend ok with CLX?
12640,I was telling friends to buy GME before I found this retarded family but they told me that was a stupid waste of cash. Im so happy I found you retards
12641,"According to the TAN's own website: https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=investor&amp;ticker=TAN  unless i am reading this wrong, the upcoming dividend is 0.09224 and it is only being distributed once a year?"
12642,Are you not allowed to buy options on margin? I thought you could. That's how I lost a bunch of $ back in September in matter of fact.

12644,$22.72! He almost hit it briefly today
12645, it's sedtheemighty approved. Name checks out.

12647,"Hats off to you guys for buying options with volatily that gives me a heartattack, even tho I only have shares"
12648,What the hell are leaps
12649,All arbitrage is risk-free. LOL
12650,"I am new so sorry to pile on, does that mean the premium you bought for went up, you sold and reinvested into 150 and have leftover? At what % do you typically sell contracts at?"
12651,You haven’t steered me wrong yet so can’t argue with that logic Dr.
12652,MSOS 1/15 $37c  for $1.10 looking juicy right now ..
12653,Gains are gains!
12654,Granted I didn't know half the stuff on the stock that I do now but the new console cycle was coming and the fact that they were paying debts early alone was enough for me not for my friends though their loss
12655,Santa rally might squeeze shorts a bit more aggressively this year 💎🙏
12656,When you say you rolled does that mean you sold the contract for a profit and bought a new one farther otm or what? Couldn't you just have kept the old one and kept gaining on that one if ark kept going up though? What's the reasoning for rolling out?
12657,The poor retard can't even type PLTR and that means  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀!
12658,Its Ryan Cohen. Not Stephen Cohen. JFC you guys are retarded. Point 72 is not buying GME
12659,I too am converted. Started buying TSLA in 2017 and did great. Was a Bear on everything and made good money in March.  Tried ThetaGang on poor mans covered calls in April but got destroyed.  Went full Bull in May and I may be able to retire early.   Individually many of us are indeed retarded.  Collectively we have the wisdom of Crowds.  We literally can’t go tits up.
12660,wow you ended it with x3 bagger yolo being a gay bear with some college loan refunds. That’s why you don’t gay bear. Those are pussy returns. I’ll be waiting for the diss track that drops from your wife’s boyfriend.
12661,I’m gonna short you guys and laugh all the way down
12662,Ha ha. You are a clever one Mark!
12663,Yet all the people here think it's canon
12664,Yeah IV is crazy but can go higher if we have more positive news &amp; Cohen buying more shares to replace the board
12665,"I bought the July $110 ARKG calls last when the stock was sitting at $95. They are up 75% since then. My only regret, or course, is that I did not buy more."
12666,"Im super retarded, ELI5? What should I be looking at to see what you are seeing?"
12667,Stephen Cohen seeded Melvin capital the money to start up. Now they are shorting GME. Sort of ironic when you confuse them.
12668,So when buy calls?
12669,Are they? I see 27k shares long reported as of 09/30. It’s still a very minor exposure and probably market neutral or smth
12670,"Sorry man, the retard factor at WSB Is cumulative i'm afraid. I'm trying to convince the betas to jump on the ship to Valhalla with me!!  I get rewarded with shitpost from anxious shorts or plain old fashion ignorance. Critical thinking isn't in style these days. Not than I'm perfect, I fuck up trades like the rest of you.  I can sleep at night with PLTR at these levels. I know this stock is still cheap."
12671,"So $GME seems to be experiencing two squeezes at the moment:  1. Gamma squeeze: began because a lot of autists likes us bought a ton of short-dated call options, which in turns made the MMs selling the call options to buy the underlying stock so that they have zero net exposure (delta hedge). Remember MMs need commissions and do not want to hold a trade either long or short. The more short-dated options on GME we buy the more this forces MMs to buy the underlying stock, which pushes the share price higher. Look up call options open interest for $GME   2. Short squeeze: So now we established that gamma squeeze is driving the stock price up. We also know that the short interest on GME is to the tune of 100% of the free float. If stock price keeps growing due to Gamma squeeze, short sellers will start to cover their positions, purchasing large volumes of $GME stock. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes a further rise in the stock's price. This newly increased price can in-turn trigger additional margin calls and short covering, which in turn may drive up the price further still in a vicious feedback loop 🚀🚀🚀. Look up short interest for $GME"
12672,"Got it, so in theory you want to do it on a stock you believe in long-term, and sell relatively deep OTM weeklies."
12673,he has the midas touch
12674,Sold 2 tsla contracts 460c for 1k in a week underlying went up to 600 lost 200k + don’t/can’t repurchase at this price
12675,Top is in soon. This type of shit always confirms it.
12676,"OUCH, so not always the best idea."
12677,"I recommend playing options extra safe and buy a few months out. No more then 10-15 % of your account  It seems great and all seeing weeklies skyrocket, but your account can be wiped to zero in a matter of minutes if things don’t go well"
12678,"PTON sells bike with iPad? Apple sells only iPad. yuuuge arbitrage, risk free my friend. all in!!!"
12679,A man of culture.
12680,WBA has been fucking me for years and for that reason I am out.
12681,Its going over 1000 should probably not sell.i am doing everything i can to get 1k shares so i can be millionaire. Then spend it all on a bj from cathie wood.
12682,So surely it should be worth more than a company that sells ipads without an exercise bike attached.
12683,"Because RC is here to stay, and profit is like triple market cap. He can turn this shit around. Meanwhile shorts still have to cover so as long as it doesn't tank that's a steady boost as they do."
12684,RIP your asshole dude Trump just took a big greasy shit on all our tendies
12685,"lol, you ain't wrong.  But I do have confidence in this and most alternative energy ETFs, at least for the first ~100 days of Biden's presidency."
12686,I can tell you're from the Midwest. Northern Midwest
12687,"I wonder how much cheaper a Peloton would be if you could just hook up your actual iPad to it. You know, the iPad you already own? That they could make an app for instead of making you buy a whole 2nd iPad attached to the bike?   Fr I don’t have the tendies for a Peloton"
12688,Why does it go down by the dividend amount? Is it because of a usual sell off?
12689,hmmm yeah that actually seems like a good idea.  Low risk high reward shit
12690,"I just looked on yahoo finance, so the company’s own info is probably more accurate."
12691,I'm MOFO in Calls now
12692,"That the stock doesn’t go up, same as any long call."
12693,I was just fucking with you saying thats your biggest risk.  I have a couple green plays one being a different etf.  I think the whole industry is going to ride up but I will probably get out sometime soonish as weird as that sounds  edit: keep riding up I should say
12694,"""The reason you should buy them as a hedge are because they produce a  400KT of copper, so their cost of production of gold is the lowest in  the industry.""  Explain. I thought KL had the lowest extraction costs in the industry below 500$/oz  ""This is why you want to buy $GOLD LEAP as a hedge and start positioning into it before the market makers (MM).""  Explain. Buffet went in on gold, it was in the news, there's like advertisements about it on my facegoog... will we really beat the mms there? to one of the top 3 gold producers in the world?"
12695,Because the company is paying out $X that used to be on its balance sheet. The market adjusts accordingly. This is why dividends aren’t free money and you can’t win by just jumping in and out of dividend stocks around the record date.
12696,"Got it, thanks!"
12697,"I have had similar thoughts, i figure that the rate that it has been increasing at will slow down. But i am also hopeful that Biden will make some announcements during his first 100 days that give a clearer idea of his energy policy that may reinvigorate the clean energy sector."
12698,"Damn! A 75% options return on what would’ve only been 16% shares return. I feel like I need to sell some shares and buy some options.   Are you gonna buy more? Idk how ARKG could go down over the next year, even with a potential temporary correction.   If so, what’s your strategy for buying? Or do you not really know what you’re doing? (Which is completely acceptable because I don’t really either)"
12699,got a 1/15 30c call
12700,what are you so excited about if you expect to 10x your money? gme is only trading in the 20-21 range. wait to get all jacked up when it's at 50+
12701,All brokerage houses are bucket shops- not too different from Scraton Oakmond - they just do it legally by paying law firms and the research is generally garbage propaganda
12702,It’s adorable you think any of the calls I sell are covered by anything but margin
12703,I'm europoor bro. Feels sad man :c
12704,Come on man we gon sell at one point. Some people been in since 10. Expect them not to take a 5 bagger? I'm looking for 100+ personally
12705,I thought we were trying to discourage 16yo's showing up here with their parents' IRA's. Bring the mod bots down for an hour and now we got a 16yo making tunes (rap) about investing.
12706,"WBA is going to reverse a 5 year downtrend?  Even if everyone who comes in for a vaccine also buys a snickers bar, people aren't going to go long on WBA for a 1 time bump that will go away in a year."
12707,"fyi your terminology is wrong. You have a LEAP call, not a naked LEAP call.   Naked calls refer to selling calls without having the underlying stock (very risky)."
12708,"I see the MOASS 10x potential, but I give it a 10-15% chance of happening in 2021. Maybe I'm just overly optimistic...  Why would I NOT be excited about that possibility though?  Are you the one to take my excitement away? Well, tough luck mate, I won't let you, I will keep on keeping on."
12709,Digital games are expensive as fuck. You can get disks for usually half the price or 50$ for a brand new game. You can share easier. Its not going away. Stuff like gamefly that other companies are going to get into even and compete soon even.
12710,Only up 137% so far what will i do???
12711,"Right lol they’re gonna compete with Walmart, target, ducking Xbox store. Only way is if they partnered with Sony or Microsoft and what do they bring to the table? Idk about anyone here but my generation hates GameStop, they’re like a shitty pawnshop that rips off kids lol"
12712,I dont see how a brick and mortar gaming store will do well. I can see it being meh at best. Are they going to give more for trade in and tickle your balls?  Doesn't mean I won't ride the rocket.
12713,"Uh, that call is expiring soon. Of course you should sell. You don't have time to wait for March when your options expire in a week."
12714,"I only partly know what I'm doing, or at least I think I partly know what I'm doing.  The ETF was hovering around $95 all last week and the July 2021 options IV was around 25-30%, which made the $8.50 premium for the $110 call seem like a steal. So, I added more shares and bought the mentioned calls. I just happened to get lucky with the timing, since ARKG popped on the 21st. This also drove up IV for the option I bought to 52%, and I'm pretty sure that jump is what made the gains appear so large. I have no doubt that over time that IV will settle back down, which will push down the options price. But, I didn't buy the calls to swing trade, I bought them because I think come July they will be well in the money and I plan on holding them until then (or until I learn more about strategies for rolling-up/out).  For now, I am going to wait for the options IV to drop back to around 25-30% before I think about buying more (although I have no special knowledge that this will actually happen). I think if ARKG trades sideways for a week or two the options IV will drop again, and that is what I'm going to be looking for. If it does happen, I will pick up more long-dated calls that are just slightly out-of-money.  Again, I do not possess any special knowledge that would give my view any weight. I definitely got lucky with the timing on the options buy, and I definitely have plenty of bad timing trades. Also, I'm generally bullish on biotech for 2021, a view that others may not share."
12715,I did my DD and this stock has the potential to touch 5000 000. This is also confirmed by the trend of the chart
12716,I demand you make a Yolo post proving this. Mods here this call ololololololololo
12717,"How’d you learn this shit (the Greeks, squeeze, etc.) Straight up google or..? I want to learn. I’ve learned that I think I want to be a retard here on WSB, but also understand what the hell is gng on. GME first option ever. 1 entire contract Lol. $18 Dec 31."
12718,10% in a month? I'm up 10% today..you gotta pump dem numbers up rookie🚀🚀🚀
12719,Not really. It’s pretty safe when it’s out of the money. This is a casino and the call sellers are the house.
12720,Who is this doctor and why is he so awesome???
12721,Lmao  I mean I know were all retards but...
12722,Yes. It hurts. And have to hold it for another month.
12723,"They are worth more than the shitty iPad company by like 40 bucks, just buy it"
12724,Was about to buy calls on wm
12725,"Market value by monday is on track for $24, if not hit tmrw for a christmas homerun   🚀🚀🚀 BUY SHARES, RUIN MELVIN"
12726,"Interesting! You seem smart so how far out should I go on calls, April July itm or atm?"
12727,"News and shorts/puts usually. Or rating it as hold vs buy, setting a low price target. Dumb bullshit that usually shouldn't matter if the company is solid. And all these contacts are looking solid."
12728,How did you find out that the options were so much cheaper far out like that? I thought they get more expensive as you go out with time?
12729,Can't wait to buy the peloton converter upgrade that lets my pedaling generate electricity into the grid. I stay pedaling in the dark so those dividends get reinvested.
12730,It’s the BA that makes him awesome. All his other alphabet-soup qualifications are retarded.
12731,"GME has MORE revenue than ATVI in 2019...yet their market cap is about 49x as much. If GME can just reduce costs, either by shutting down stores or converting them into esports centers (still think they should sell their worst performing stores to amazon. amazon could use them for fulfillment centers), or at the very least offloading the worst performing stores, and using that capital to shift to ecommerce. better the website etc. they could easily go to $100 a share for real"
12732,Peloton seems like such a waste of money
12733,"A week ago. Or right now, it doesn't matter that much if you dont buy weeklies"
12734,"hey!!! he's a fucking esquire, retard. You know  how hard he worked for that?"
12735,bro if it actually hit $1000 a share and I held until that point I would have enough money to make what are you doing step bro? videos with myself as the main actor
12736,If the company can execute a turn around strategy lol
12737,"FDs are tons of fun, but LEAPs are the way.   GE 1/22 F 1/22 FCEL 2/19/21 ICLN 1/15/21  Currently rowing my boat to buying a farm. If I can't keep my hands off these FDs I might be buying a farm in a different sense"
12738,"$500? WTF, A M Z N and S H O P are retail babies at around 2K/share. Palantir has a much more noble mission. Selling at around $2400.00"
12739,Every day I ask myself it is too late to join   Is it?
12740,So the question is...buy stocks or OTM leaps?
12741,Another 15% needed in a little over a month after being up 100% in just the past 3.    Welcome home.
12742,"Dude watch any symposium on YouTube and Thiel straight up tells you the only smart investments are in companies with secrets and a monopolistic stranglehold on the market. IE: PayPal, FB, Palantir. If you don't understand the importance of that go buy shares of the Cheesecake Factory"
12743,Yeah its a good hold I'd say.  Lately I am trying to trim my portfolio and play a little more aggressively while we are in this type of market.  Getting rid of all my long plays actually.  Might hold PLTR and sell CC though
12744,This arbitrage can’t go tits up
12745,"In theory if the market is perfect, yes, you can't win by jumping in/out for dividends.  However the market isn't perfect. On a widely traded security, investors with a long term hold with a DRIP may spend a portion of their dividend to rebuy the stock itself. The difference may be incredibly small, but with no transaction costs, traded in say, an IRA for tax advantages, you could theoretically pull pennies.  &amp;#x200B;  I might just be fucking retarded though."
12746,She didn’t buy that high. Last time she bought was Nov 13. Ended at 15.80 that day
12747,I worked for WBA corporate. It's a mess. Why do you think it's been downtrending for years. I would advise you against this play.
12748,Was only a matter of time before someone started showcasing their 'hot' mixtape cause the sub has 'street' in it.
12749,"Thanks for the reply! I need to look more into IV and all the other stats for option contracts I think before I dive in but, that’s good to know. Congrats on the while timed calls.   I’m actually making a little excel file that I can use to help myself understand how different factors affect returns. My main decision when bullish on a stock is: calls or shares?  I’m hoping this file proves useful."
12750,"I don’t know. Solar probably isn’t going anywhere and it’s pushing the old stuff out of competition. Exelon, for one, is taking a couple of nuclear plants offline next year and I heard it was because of the big solar programs being pushed right now."
12751,"No she keeps adding man. Not in a large way, probably for a trade."
12752,"Just wait a few months,  back in the poor house"
12753,Audible has his audio book Zero to One.   Papa Peter Thiel will use my money better than I will. My day job gives me enough allownce for tendies.  So I bought his uncontested tendie machine. 💎 🙌
12754,It’s only overvalued if you primarily think of them as a car company. If you look at their other lines of businesses the valuation makes sense. Their phones have a lot of potential.
12755,That's one treasury purchase away from a moderately sensible plan.
12756,did you just buy the stock now? I am wanting to buy some more but wasn't sure if I missed the rocket
12757,"Don't worry, tons of retards think it is. One retard literally told me, it's free money, but he doesn't do it because his long portfolio does better (retard therefore doesn't understand it's not free money).   If you even remotely understood options (which people here obviously don't) they would know that selling calls is a boomer strategy designed to lower portfolio volatility. The expected outcome of the strategy is that you underperform... But since learning about options is taboo here, people preach this idiocy."
12758,to be a succesful yoloer you need to know how to fuck
12759,I lol'd at this...
12760,You’re the one whose head the joke is flying over. The common response to criticism of Tesla’s valuation is “only if you think of them as just a car company”. My comment was a parody of this.
12761,"capping your upside is the worst thing you can do, as small individual investors we need to let our winners run to be successful  the reason is that real winning stocks are rare, when you have one you need to keep it"
12762,"He’s looking into the future? Will that be tomorrow? Who the f knows, sure hope so. My weekly lottos will appreciate it."
12763,I thought you were all autists until I became a GME autist..
12764,jesus. I tried tsla credit spreads this week and finally cashed in up a bit but the rollercoaster gave me multiple heart attacks. A 200k+ loss? the pain. I hope you're doing better
12765,"What I have been doing with CRSR is selling covered calls whenever the stock rockets. I buy the call back immediately after I'm positive on the trade. A few days ago when CRSR rocketed I sold 3 covered calls for a total of $2,100 and bought them back a few hours later. I only netted $700 but if you do this consistently it adds up so you get to make money without having to get rid of your shares."
12766,"he didnt really lost it, more like he couldnt realize those gains and his position probably got called away at 460. Depends on where he bought the loss or gain on the position."
12767,Thanks for the explanation. I’m going to go ahead and uninstall my life. Have a day.
12768,This is so confusing but I can tell is  valuable info so I’m commenting to dissect later
12769,Attach you iPad to a $20 stationary bike
12770,I feel like it went from 90% options to 70% options so stocks are like 3x as popular now.
12771,We may have propped it up a bit pre earnings but none of this spike is from our 5%. Hence my point that we can’t move the market as our 5% didn’t do much. Unless you are telling me we need a recount and we now have 15%+ which I couldn’t imagine
12772,Give me a day to hear it all. I watched a few of his interviews on youtube. He's a risk taker and thinks on his feet. Very interesting man.
12773,ETF's are simply just the way to go for me personally. Fortune favors the bold for those playing options. But as long as I am beating the S&amp;P 500 every year then I don't care.
12774,People usually do this so that the shares can’t be shorted. You put in a sell order for a stupid high price and those shares aren’t allowed to be be lent out to shorts by your broker. Now you don’t need to place a sell order for $199k to achieve this but that’s what I assume is being done here.
12775,"Even though it looks so low quality, took me a great deal of time to complete.  I wanted to celebrate the daily race we all endure in a quest of profits. It has been a while ride and I hope you guys make big tendies."

12793,"“Expires 100% worthless” , how did you manage to capture a WSB trader so clearly? Beautiful."
12794,"For once I agree with the GME bull thesis after months of not touching the stock.  Short squeeze aside, lets be honest, Cohen and co. is not buying GME because of their boomer brick and mortar stores.  It's very likely he is pushing GME to e-commerce.  I see GME essentially going the Steam route and having their own gaming platform to publish their own indy titles have having deals with devs, including platform exclusive bonuses/dlc.  I believe that's the end game here."

12807,"QS is going to take your money, say “oh we just couldn’t quite commercialize it, yields were too low by 3 orders of magnitude”, and disappear into the night.   Literally zero battery breakthrough companies have ever delivered. And there are new ones every day."
12808,"I didn't click play,just thought you meant, ""it feels john goodman""."
12809,I lost it at that moment. Hit too hard.
12810,"Let’s see if we can reach 99.999999%, we still have 30 seconds of market."
12811,I read it all. This is art. I love you  Diamond hands forever.
12812,"Sir, this is a school for kids who don’t read good."
12813,"Fold type companies are the future, unfolding and decoding people's genome to find issues and crsp fix them"
12814,Ha - Should have really found a way to work that reference in here too...
12815,"I mean I'm in 5 figures in GME but I think some of your interpretations are a little generous. For instance, 4/5 of those places in that holiday gifts poll. It's obviously influenced by the new console cycle, and all those places sell the same consoles (cept for the dollar store). Taken at face value, that list shows that GME is behind insurmountable competitors for the items it specializes in the most. And at least their competitors offer a wide range of other products and not Funko Pops. I mean there's other stuff too here that's problematic, and it's especially problematic because there is GOOD info too about how this is a healthy company. But when you start seeing every single bit of information as some kind of confirmation, you're way off the deep end my dude."
12816,This is it. This is the best one so far.
12817,I'm prepared to lose 50% on this. I'm in PLTR. Looks like a low market volume dip and rebound is about to play out today. There was the dip.   Congrats if you played.
12818,So youre saying buy more today?
12819,🥲 puts on r/wsb   After drive-thru folding and unfolding fixes chromosomes and autism become a thing.
12820,Want some DMT instead? 😉 you deserve it for all the $GME support
12821,My point in citing that was to show that people obviously still buy shit at GameStop (which sometimes surprises me) and that it’s not soon to be bankrupt. Is that pretty limited point off the deep end?
12822,i was smelling $100. it hit $104. Market is doing morning dip shake out.
12823,this is not nam. there are rules.  FUCK this is an amazing effort post. tally 'ho boys and girls!
12824,I actually went to a Gamestop yesterday and I noticed that they added .com to their logo on the storefront. When did this happen?
12825,"I absolutely loved this cartoon so this movie is 10/10 for me, definitely not winning any academy awards but it does what it sets out to perfectly.   ""You dont use the margin because youre a trader, you do it because youre retarded"" lmao I feel attacked"
12826,I’d debate you but I’m looking at my positions and have nothing to say anymore.
12827,"Bro, you are the goddamn Kerouac of DD"
12828,"Speed Racer is an underrated gem of a batshit insane movie   It loud, it’s insanely shiny, it’s dumb as all hell and I love it  This is the perfect film for WSB to meme on"
12829,Don’t talk shit about Bed Bath and Beyond. I’m balls deep in that bitch. They have a competent CEO finally. They shorts got squeezed out of them last earnings release. Burry was in them also.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 - GME  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 - BBBY
12830,Cohen is a total badass. At this point I’m so invested in GME I want them to do a complete rebranding and deliver on digital marketing. I went through their Instagram a few weeks ago and it was severely lacking... looked like a bunch of boomers threw their print ads onto it
12831,"Yes, it’s a revolution, I’m buying dips all the way ip"
12832,Tesla shares 5 years ago still aren't worth what they are doing today.
12833,Right with you man. It felt this scene was made for this.
12834,"See, you learn something new every day. BBBY to the moon!"
12835,Dude when I saw this I knew I was in for a great meme. Speed racer is an underrated gem.
12836,"Is there a way to see how much the larger short positions are in the red, at this point? Looking for dollar figures."
12837,Beautiful. Just beautiful. Let us take you to a whole new world Jim. Think tendie town but now with video games
12838,"Fuck this, all that text and 3 rockets at the end."
12839,"Yep, the only thing the sword of Damocles isn’t cutting through is our diamond hands and steel balls."
12840,"Never had even close to “all my money” in WSB and I was feeling the rush... Guess you can call me that kid drawing the scribbles, just sub in March 2020 for 2008. Great content!"
12841,Ark themselves have a ton of faith in PACB for it
12842,"You know, I had my broker give me 18k of margin on a 32k account.     I just put the amount to 0 and stayed back, temptation was too high."
12843,"i just bagged 65% on GameStop faggies, so who's retarded now you fuckin dinosaur"
12844,Imagine typing all this only to have automod delete it lmao  great post for real  GME 🚀🚀 🌕
12845,"lol that drawing of a car crash subtitled with ""2008 Crash"""
12846,You’re awesome man
12847,You're missing out man!
12848,I had like 35k margin back in March and that bet did not go my way lol this video really resonates with me it was a bitch clawing back from that hole
12849,"Holy fuck, the dude wrote a book..."
12850,How can I trust the DD when you can’t even get the movie quote right.   Walter was talking not The Dude.
12851,"For the record, GME Is a value stock. Burry got in cause he saw value where everyone else saw nothing"
12852,"I'd say ""this is patrick"" but yeah, this one is my magnum opus."
12853,it was so obvious when I was searching for an idea for that part.
12854,"Once those PIPE shares unlock and are ready to be sold, its gonna dip bigly. This is coming soon in the next few weeks so definitely don’t buy or even short this stock.   Stay the fuck back from QS"
12855,Did you... Did you hit the character cap for a post???
12856,If I wanted to read a book I would go to the library.
12857,Honestly its underrated - it's a good movie
12858,That was captivating AF! Well done! What happens in the movie? He loses the race?
12859,"Finally, a Speed Racer meme on Reddit"
12860,Props man. Best read on WSB ever. HOF material. Well written. Well sourced. Funny as fuck.
12861,Missed opportunity to use [this](https://youtu.be/S18Hm1q0srE) version. To be fair it probably would have taken away the talking points.
12862,"&gt;FYI: it’s pronounced “Mee-Mee.”  What the fuck, no it isn't. That's the most sus boomer shit I've seen all day. That and the fact that you think we can read even 1% of that drivel."
12863,"You know what I mean, the stock that grow +1/2% each year and serve a dividend. Nice long term but we ain't here for that."
12864,Tesla helped NIO climb didn't it? The mindset has swung because the impossible is now possible.
12865,"Speed racer, and despite spoiling the end, I recommend it to you."
12866,This movie isn't great but I love it. This scene is amazing and you've shown it true justice. 👏
12867,"I can't be the first one, can I?"
12868,Amazing. The mummy has so many good scenes for wsb
12869,Well fuck you then
12870,"I am a simple man, I see u/CPTHubbard, I diligently pour through every word of wisdom ascribed, emerging a smarter, even more diamond hand encrusted disciple out the other end💎  As far as early Christmas presents go, the above ranks amongst the finest 👏👏  🎄Merry Christmas to you CPT and never, ever change."
12871,"Not much of a coke guy, it interferes with the Speed."
12872,All those people cheering need to be PLTR TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀s 😂😂 great work!
12873,Congrats : ) GME is not a long term hold. Blockbuster video type headwinds. Digital gaming has castrated GameStop. But it is a well executed business and will bleed for another decade until it folds.  Plastic DVD generator type business. People switch games like they switch condoms.
12874,Thx for this wall of Text. Great work! Didnt read all though...  Who is driving the Stock price up at the moment? Rc? Some Hedgefonds? Already the shorts? Maybe you have some insights for a retard New to Stock market. Thx!
12875,"I made it stock agnostic, but I agree PLTR 🚀"
12876,You son of a bitch take my Gold!
12877,"Holy shit this post  Positions: Shares around $19 , and calls hoping on a squeeze"
12878,What money is that? Tesla is now worth more than entire US oil industry. That's insane. If anything money will come flooding back into oil as people seek yield in a ZIRP world.
12879,This! The price de resistance
12880,"I get it, you went short. GL."
12881,K.
12882,God damn now that I’ve read War &amp; Peace and all the blood entered my phallus... GME 🚀🚀🚀
12883,"Yeah I did, funnily enough it was all in my Roth too so no tax bill when I was looking at a hefty bill earlier. I went from up 350% to - 20% to +80%, such a crazy year."
12884,If you ever write a book. Link it asap I’m buying.
12885,In 2010 I couldn't YOLO all my Wendy's paychecks into 0DTE calls on this thing while sitting on the shitter staring at my phone. QS just went public and RH will drink this sucker up!! $200 and beyond!!  🚀  🚀  🚀
12886,Cramer ain't a gamer
12887,"Thank you man, happy you like it!"
12888,"Holy shit, good to hear. A shame about the 350 but 80 is better than a kick in the arse."
12889,This was a crazy movie.
12890,Don’t tell others but I did too when watching the scene the first time.
12891,This sub is truly one of the dumbest places on earth. Well done
12892,"Shit man. Today was the first day of leave and I toked up after not having toked for a while. Just put on the newest season of The Expanse. Realized shit markets are open. Check the charts, obviously gotta go do my daily DD, log into Reddit. This is the first post I see on WSB."
12893,"If you think an activist investor is going to sit back and watch you retards meme this stock beyond his fair value estimate and not happily sell to you then report that...well this will be fun to watch.  Can't wait to read the ""REEEEE gamestop without Cohen's sword of damocles over the shorts is just...gamestop!"" loss porn."
12894,"Holy shit, a Speed Racer meme! All I wanted as a kid was a Mach 5 when I grew up."
12895,Your tldr was too long so I also didn't read.
12896,"holding my 11,800 until it hits $50+"
12897,This was hilarious. Only thing that could have made it better is if the Asian guy at 1:45 shouted NIO TO THE MOOOOON
12898,"Fuck that dude, this is high quality as shit. If you took the time to make this, don’t let anyone tell you it’s shit. Keep trading, retard"
12899,Can we talk about how this movie was criminally underrated? It had fantastic visuals and it was one of the most faithful anime adaptations ever (if not the only actually good adaptation).  Just look at this clip. Shit was a work of art.
12900,Why do I choose all the wrong memes  🥺     GME 🚀
12901,I’ve never read anything this long in my life and I’m not starting now
12902,"welp, I'll wait for the dip today and buy more shares now. God damnit"
12903,Holy shit the fact that Speed Racer of all damn things is on WSB makes me really question what the hell I'm doing here
12904,I actually teared up a little thanks you gaybois
12905,"This is a fuckin AAA grade meme. Well done sir, well done"
12906,"U fucking asshole. My boss HAS to be pissed at me for shitting away the last half hour reading this. On the other hand, it was worth it. Onward and upward you brilliant mother fucker."
12907,"Simple rule, buy low, sell high. Always profit."
12908,Kinda a weird comment to make after my dude just bought 2.5M shares last week. But ok man.
12909,This was fucking beautiful man. May tendies rain down upon us all 🙏
12910,"Sir, if this is a casino, you're playing craps and I'm mirroring all your moves after that. That was phenomenal. Congratulations and fuck you.  See you all in Valhalla"
12911,"I like to consider that +350% as my options/WSB tuition.   Sometimes you're flush and sometimes you're bust, and when you're up, it's never as good as it seems, and when you're down, you never think you'll be up again, but life goes on  How was your year? did you make it to 100%?"
12912,"that will print... the 12/24 pltr 30C, well i hope they print.... but RIP prolly cause of MM's manipulation. i cried too lol."
12913,Didn’t read but upvoted for effort
12914,"Well Speed Racer, you know what you're doing tonight."
12915,"It was too much in advance I think. The details are wild, you know the scene when he drives vertical and the track pulls up, you see the building behind changing direction as well and it's sooo well done. The parralax effect is perfect."
12916,You're not alone my friend.
12917,"Rocket kids, hah, I love it.  Still trying to unpack all of the subtle refences."
12918,The celebrity died of a heroin overdose too.
12919,"Agree with you.     Was about 98% gain, then down to 10%, now coming back to 20%.     never saw above 100% actually, so there's a lot of me in this meme. chasing the elusive 100% when people do it easy, only to have it elude me at the last second."
12920,"Just imagine Cramer and all the other boomers driving around the last mall open only to find all of the spots at the woolworths are taken. After two hours of solid crazy Ivan’s he finally cuts off some emo punk and gets his spot almost right in front. While he is busy shutting off his car phone he notices that all these people are not at Woolworths but they are actually heading into GameStop. This has got to stop he says, puts on GameStop."
12921,lost a lot this year - but the dank memes gave me phenomenal emotional gains. Happy holidays y’all
12922,LETS GET IT UP
12923,This is exactly how it feels. Fucking nerve wrecking
12924,I don't think I have the ADHD to watch this. Maybe after a line or 2.
12925,"Just curious how long does making something like this take? Love it btw, especially the ending 😂"
12926,"Can someone pacify my one bear thought so I can finally get a second mortgage and go completely fucking in on this instead of just a measly 800 shares?     I'm about the most cynical bastard I know, and my only thought ever since people really caught onto the extreme short interest was ""those fuckers at Melvin have a backdoor out somehow"".  So they just keep doubling down and keep doubling down...because they have a fucking back door.  And so far no one has figured out what the back door is!  I think that the additional shares offered at earnings was supposed to be the back door to save the fuckers at Melvin from the MOASS, but then Daddy Cohen came and squashed it like the baller that he is by increasing his stake...however, shorts still haven't covered yet...and I'm convinced there's still another back door that none of us have seen.     The fuckers at Melvin capital didn't become  the cigar smoking millionaires that they are by doing bad research.  I'm sure they could see the valuation in the company and saw Gamestop pay off a bunch of its debt early...and they kept doubling down going into a console cycle...because they know theres another back door.        WHAT IS THE BACK DOOR??!?!?!?! Someone tell me please so I can fully commit"
12927,"Bro, i have a 65k short going tits up but I couldn’t be happier bc of this"
12928,"The first few paragraphs I read were great. That said, how the absolute fuck did you write all of this ?  I say this as someone who wrote a book."
12929,"It probably won't for me, I pretty much bought them at peak and I'm just hoping to get back to -50% at this point."
12930,If all us sub 1k shares combine we too can be the big boys
12931,I saw the 3:20 time and wondered if I had the attention span this early and had tears by the end. Although I also had my portfolio open so that could have been a factor.
12932,Retard I love it haha
12933,Can you remake this with that one version that added The Top from Initial D
12934,This was beautiful. Brought a tear to my eye
12935,This was NOT low quality. Thank you for this precious gift.
12936,BEST DD EVER
12937,A true masterpiece
12938,"All I do is buy, buy, buy no matter what  **🚀🚀** **🚀🚀**    Everybody stonks go up **🚀🚀** **🚀🚀**    And they stay there **🚀🚀** **🚀🚀**"
12939,Yea you don’t know what you’re talking about lol
12940,"As someone who watched Speed Racer growing up and, for some reason, has everything riding on GameStop, I almost started crying."
12941,I might let a few shares go at 50
12942,"Video won't play, wtf?"
12943,The crazy part is that you all still have time to get back in. Its going to 50+
12944,"I mean, when companies moon on intangible promises it usually works out here, right?"
12945,wat is that
12946,"No, when they crash and the car gets destroyed the driver becomes encased in a protective bubble and they bounce away."
12947,Imma frame that quote and put it above my 9 trading monitors.
12948,"Imagine if he looked at EGS and their launch, did that but without the scummy business practices and kept the increased percentage for developers (steam is 30% while EGS is what? 25%? 20%? It was the only thing that made their storefront viable early on but the predatory game deals and lack of features left a bad taste in a lot of gamers’ mouths (they are a relatively whiny bunch of customers though, to be fair)."
12949,I am so happy
12950,It's literally my favorite movie. This made me so happy to watch.   If only I knew anything about stonks.
12951,Bravo..Bravo...  You should consider firing your editor. All you need is a picture with crayon drawings to make it atop The NY Times best seller list.  Anybody know where I can download the audiobook?  1250 shares. Let’s 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
12952,Never thought I'd actually yolo but over the last 2 weeks more &amp; more of my total account is balls deep in GME. 💎✊!!! 🔪🐻!!
12953,"This is sooo well done, bravo"
12954,"Wth? Cohen bought his shares at around $4 and could have sold at $19, but instead he bought more at the DIP. Now you are telling me he is going to sell all his shares?"
12955,It's a live action anime practically
12956,I think PLTR hitting $50 is a better shot at QS hitting $200.
12957,Assume you’re replying to the dude above me here.
12958,"As someone who is nearly 30 and with less than $500 to my name, this meme really cheered me up and made me forget about life for a while. Thanks man."
12959,"For sure, I bet the farm on PLTR. The tractor on NIO and FSR. And the farmer's daughter next door on QS. She puts out just amazing. Can't get enough."
12960,"It's all about yearly portfolio to show investors.  ""We made % in Q4 of 2020, and made % total in 2020"".   If they are burning cash on shorts, they gotta close those positions to show a better 2020 on their books."
12961,"Of course it won't ever, it's just shorters and 🌈🐻 getting desperate and mad that their puts are making them lose tons of money. If GME boards refuse to fucking transit then it'll make the hostile takeover even more likely. I have no fucking idea why GameStop refuses to build up an ecommerce platform, it's like the board boomers are allergic to making more money and only believe in brick and mortar."
12962,Whoa it’s available.
12963,"This was pure gold. Loved every second of it, then looked at my portfolio and shed a tear. Keep making them, if this is your definition of ""low quality"" can't wait to see your average stuff."
12964,“You only need 3-5 winners to be a very very rich man”- Buffett    See you in Valhalla sir.
12965,"Considering I value my time at $200/hr, someone will need to pay me about $800 to read all of this.  No matter, GME to $150 see you there."
12966,"I unironically love this scene in particular. If this film is ever rereleased on IMAX, I'm going to eat more weed edibles than medically recommended and watch it from the front row."
12967,"I was going to throw more into pltr, but this DD sold me. More GME 🚀🚀🚀"
12968,Jesus one hell of a write up!
12969,It will be glorious. All the luck to you too man.
12970,"It reminds me of that Kids Baking Championship show. When one kid gets eliminated and starts crying all the other kids hug em and say ""keep baking!""  So yeah, keep trading, retards"
12971,Christina Ricci is a real life anime waifu
12972,So buy GME right?
12973,A. I love this sub B. I'm not crying C. Is the movie actually worth watching?
12974,"....and now I am explaining to my wife why I am crying on the shitter, again.   This is the holiday gift that I didn’t know I wanted. Pure brilliance and thank you!   Happy Holidays and keep trading, retard."
12975,"Nah, I just made 39 bucks from my $200 gme calls that expire tomorrow and spent the last week or so at $0.01 ($2 if I could have even sold them). diamond hands!"
12976,«You do it because you’re retarded» I’m fucking dying
12977,"Man, This movie is one of my GEMs. I know its not for everyone... but It was fun, bright, and campy.      And the fact that they aggressively stuck to the source material... Might have to give this movie a watch again soon.     Also felt this too, Lost all my money at the beginning.. but you Degens helped me get it all back"
12978,"I went to an actual casino last weekend and was up 80% at one point, told myself I’d leave at 100% profit.  Left empty handed in the end, lost it all. This place has poisoned my mind."
12979,Why is Ben Shapiro racing?
12980,This movie is visually absolutely stunning. Kudos for a good choice for a meme
12981,Started a small position today because of this post. Surely it’ll fuck me but let’s see
12982,PLTR $60C 15/06/2021  YOU HEAR IT FIRST!
12983,I say that everytime... then the guy on my shoulder says it will go higher
12984,I made my SO watch this just yesterday and I had forgotten why I had a physical copy
12985,"Yep, you can see it in this scene before it starts again, but I cut it."
12986,"But we still love it, don’t we?"
12987,Hehe we could have a YouTube channel
12988,This is a piece of art.
12989,You know you have a problem when this video brings tears in your eyes
12990,I am with you on that one. It is very misunderstood but the Wachowskis directing is flawless and everything about it is amazing
12991,"Took me 1 hour of screening movies, then 1 hour to make the first run then 30 minutes to modify text and change the lines to make them more funny/match the spoken words. But I have a software that makes it easy (FCP)"
12992,Low quality? This was amazing!!! Expires 100% worthless had me dead
12993,Glad you like it man!
12994,"Yup. Started the market dump down 60K after margin yoloing, went back up to +20K (80K swing in literally a month during the July pump) now back to late March -60K after being down 90K during the pre-election dump.  Didn't accomplish anything other than hitting refresh several thousand times a day.  Meanwhile all the boomer stocks I unloaded during the margin destruction would have my account up 200K."
12995,Has there been any suggestion they're developing a gaming platform? They obviously should but they have not mentioned anything of the sort on their CCs
12996,Well I also had tears when watching the scene at first!
12997,I was thinking the other night about a gambling platform for gaming. Think about it...
12998,"alright, I have finished reading it. Your posts are more interesting than some books I read.. keep them coming man!"
12999,"It’s 12 year old, back then it looked pretty good!"
13000,thats exactly what I did when I first watched it in theaters
13001,I tear up at the flashback watching Asian futures all night. That’s just the kind of scene I really really love.
13002,"You are most welcome brother. I don’t know about your situation but two years ago I was with a negative 20k net worth. Meditation helped me and by having a clearer mind, I managed to crawl back from my hole.   /r/Meditation has great info and if you give it a chance, it might just help you a little bit!  Glad my meme made you enjoy life a little bit!"
13003,I'm partial to that first transition at the beginning from the empty track to the neon night race it's just...*chef's kiss*
13004,"that is what your wife tells you, but you know deep inside it really never works..."
13005,"Don’t worry brother, I have more in stock to post! Thank you for the praise."
13006,"I really enjoy this scene too, it’s well made and has tons of emotion to it. Yeah it’s about a fake race but fuck the flashback hit home hard."
13007,Yes! Well now you know the end but give it a chance. It’s not the best movie but it’s definitely a good vibe thing.
13008,"""Stay up all night watching Asian futures""  holy shit that was funny"
13009,You are so welcome! Don’t worry I teared up too and so many people send the same feedback! Under our fleshy meet and spooky skeleton we do have them feelings too you know.
13010,So glad I watched it all. Fuckin hilarious
13011,This has to be the best sub on Reddit
13012,You sir are an artist. Im broke af rn but here is gold bc u erned it. (got2 mk sur jim cnt rd dis)
13013,You know they act like that lol. “stoop hiiiiiim” cat screaming meme.png
13014,Gains are gains!
13015,Well is there any other explaining?
13016,All of it
13017,"There is a “goofy” quality to their movies. They have their weird moments but they always leave me feeling something, which is the goal of the medium I think."
13018,"Nope, you nailed it! Speed Racer is also a masterpiece, so this is just magnificent in every aspect possible."
13019,Brooo I know what you mean. I went from whole portfolio 80 to 20% gain. A guy before told me he went from 350 to 80. Gains are gains and we should learn to take them when we can.  (But we won’t)
13020,Holy shit I can’t unsee it now.
13021,GME has split 3 times by the time i finish this.

13035,Just make the text a little bigger on your next one for us mobile Reddit guys.
13036,I’m honestly so pumped by this. I don’t see how this is not going to propel us to ATH.

13043,"Nacho cheese, cheese that isn’t even cheese at all, is the best kind of cheese   This movie is pure Nacho Cheese"
13044,Clawback rule now that he is an insider. Can't sell for many months otherwise all his profits go to the company.  So no he is not going to 'happily sell' to everyone here.
13045,"Is this spliced together by you or did they actually make the movie this bad?  Great work by you, not so much by the movie industry."
13046,Desktop Metal (DM) is such a beast
13047,"Hi there, WSB. Short time lurker, first time poster. I hate capitalism, I hate Wall Street, and there's a significantly likelihood that I hate most people on this sub, but HOLY FUCKING SHIT do I love this movie."
13048,Second only to deconstructed stuffed bell peppers. Yum.
13049,"Save the Zoolander references for your next missive. A gentleman of your talents should be able to work this piece glorious piece of monologue in: &gt; SHUT UP! Enough already, Ballstein!

And I will be a monkey's uncle if I let you ruin this for me, because if you can't get the job done, then I will!"
13050,I don’t understand one reference in this entire clip. But I fucking loved this movie and recognize good work when I see it. Nice one OP!

13052,I love all these Marley and Me memes lately
13053,This was so retarded and I haven't laughed that hard in a long time!
13054,So glad I never paid anything to see this stupid movie
13055,“You’re just a voice pal; you don’t know a damn thing about trading!”
13056,This is a movie I don’t understand the hate for. I love it!
13057,Not going to lie I didn’t read the entire thing but I did read the section on Gamestops future and once again it appears to be lacking.   What happens beyond mid 2021 when console sales catch up to demand and things taper off? Where is gamestop in 2 years when all of the next gen launch without disc drives? You speak of a pivot to “tech based gaming” but what exactly does that look like?
13058,Someone get this man a beep bop boop machine.
13059,How am I supposed to become a millionaire if I keep pulling out after measly 50% gains??

A Google for Melvin shows you appear to be talking about Melvin Capital, why are they relevant and who are they? Thinking about buying some $GME later btw"
13076,The fact that you don’t have a job
13077,Bruh speed racer? That’s so boomer
13078,On this blessed day we are all retarded.
13079,"I think we're all hyped about this. But I don't think you're trying to MLM people into a stock, evident by not giving us a price target.   If this does happen and GME short squeezes making us all lots of profits (even the dimebag holders), it's going to be historical. RC likely knows this and while his intentions aren't to be written about and studied, he knows how fucking big this would be to show institutions that retail investors can absolutely fuck you over."
13080,It’s...glorious.
13081,I assume to have the time to write this means all your funds are tied up in GME so watching the market is pointless.  GG autust. GME to the MOOOOOOOOOON.

13085,"There’s many of us man, it’s just a bit forgotten."
13086,I don't understand the word profit in they way you used it...
13087,I came for the underated movie. I don't get stock trading.  Dank meme tho.
13088,Why are you commenting about stuff when you don't even know wtf you're talking about then?  I just told you what the clawback rule is. He can't sell his shares for many months or his profits go to the company and he gets nothing.
13089,I have 530 shares at $14 and $15.50 12/31 calls. Assuming continued upward momentum i plan to exercise my calls and purchase the 500 shares at $15.50 (I'll have to shell out the $7500 - remainder of my bankroll). Alternatively I considered just selling my calls and re-buying as many as I can with profits for April (post director swap vote and q4 earnings).   I'm also open to suggestions.

13101,"I always wondered why this movie did so bad, now I know."
13102,"If you could write something more useful than ""gtfo u didnt read every dd post"" I would be convinced by some citation to what you're talking about."
13103,"If you short a stock and then have to close a bunch of positions for a loss, then you can reduce your tax burden. Only problem is it'll look like a bad Q4 for you, so you'll have some pissed off customers if you're a fund.     Being ""short"" is just buying and selling stock. The stock is borrowed and sold (short) at a price, then you wait for the price to move (hopefully down) to rebuy and return to the lender. If you have to rebuy the stocks higher that'll count as a loss."
13104,"This is beautiful, I can't stop tearing."
13105,I want to be able to write like you when I grow up.  This post made me pretty much start looking into the couch cushions looking for more cash to put into GME. I'm doing great so far but even $21 is sounding like a good deal right now.

13122,"It means he bought options (calls) that went +99.9999%, but because he held them in the hope of having 100%, he forgot to sell them before the end of the day.   They then expire and are worth zero, so -100% gain."

13126,This is hilarious. True though. Hence why I hung up my cape. Down 90% this year so for peace of mind I’m out. I’ll make money some other way that isn’t controlled by emotions and shitty politics 👍🏻

13135,You’re in for a fun ride bro!
13136,Oh shit I take so many screenshots
13137,I’ve watched both and that movie would never make me just throw out speed racer.   The movie is always in motion somehow like even the talking heads are moving across the screen.  They invented Car-Fu.  The Casa Cristo race is beautiful.  Weaponized bees.  The Zoetrope in the final race.   The finish line payoff is better in Speed Racer than redline imo.  They are very similar but the Mach 6 pulls ahead for me.
13138,Is this a Cramer GME fan fiction??
13139,Speed Racer is a masterpiece of a movie with absolutely no flaws. Change my mind.
13140,"Amazing post. Thank you. I got in at 19, just boomer stonks. But, this DD has me feeling good. Any PT in mind?"

13149,"Thanks for this, I learned a long hard, rectal-destroying lesson"
13150,"Gamestop's management is the absolute embodiment of ""consumers, not customers."" They were willing to make their shopping experience far worse by having corporate middle managers force every single employee and store manager bark at you for high-margin items like preorders/Game Informer subs/trade-ins. Who cares that literally everyone would rather go to a big box than deal with that hassle? Margins!  Meanwhile, Chewy's success has hinged upon the literal opposite, treating customers like fucking human beings instead of a way to boost Q3 revenue. I am incredibly skeptical that Ryan Cohen is going to buy a 13% stake and suddenly all the dinosaurs corporate overlords who are trying to wring every last cent from anyone unfortunate enough to walk through their doors will do a 180 and focus on making stores a nice place to be. Have you been inside a GameStop lately? It looks like 100 loot crates exploded in there."

13167,"Agreed! IMO this scene is a good fit here too:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Y-l40swH0  Back in April I was toying around with an idea where p-diddy is jpow, the game changer is the fed printing money, and everyone but p-diddy and jonah hill are call holders, but I'm not creative and nothing came of it."

13212,"It’s on my watchlist, started it a while ago and forgot. It seems great and I tend to really enjoy their work. I’m one of the rare person who enjoyed Cloud Atlas."
13213,"No worries. You're out here like the rest of us trying to print tendies, but you're using strategy.  I've had my share of PLTR calls that printed, back before Citron released their shit article. In the last month, I exercised three calls (two at $18 and one at $20) to add to my PLTR nest. Playing weeklies (naked) just in case it gaps up, but I should consider spreads. It's been trading fairly sideways the last week or two, but I think we're ready to test $30 tomorrow."
13214,"Ah yes, a man of culture"
13215,"LOL, 99% profit... yes, it might as well be a 100% loss.  Because if that shit isn't up triple digits, then it's a fuck up, and I don't care about it anymore.  Talk to me about profits when it's up 14,400%."
13216,Its been a thing for a while?

13219,Whats up with BBBY? Like a invest now for end of next quarter type thing?
13220,I am here at 150 hoping to be one of the big boys on the next one because GME takes me all the way to the top  🚀 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀
13221,I bought them back in March/April. I’m playing it as a slower boomer turnaround. These tendies are on a slow cooker not a 🚀🚀🚀.
13222,How is it possible to even write so much.
13223,"I never have any idea what's happening in this sub because I'm financially illiterate, but the gifs are always the most hype in my All feed, every day. Thanks for all the yolos.  Edit: formatting."
13224,Agreed.  This movie looks so awful.

13227,"even the TLDR is too long to read. but fuck it, with this many paragraphs about GME im all in baby"
13228,Definitely saw it on acid in college. One of my better decisions
13229,Big Jim Carrey in Man on the Moon vibes with how well this shit matched Cramer's antics. This man definitely knows how to triiiip
13230,"Basically he’s down, makes a bet and forgets to take his profit (sell). Because of this, his options expire and become worthless."
13231,Bahaha well done sir
13232,So you can spend zero dollars for options and see what happens to the stock later that day?
13233,I didn't write that. Don't put words in my mouth.  I said Cohen can't sell and provided a reason why he can't sell. That's it.
13234,"No you need to buy it, but let’s say it’s an option valid for a week. It will expire and your money will go poof irrespective of the value held by the option at expiry.  Monday buy: 3$ Friday: 4$ Monday expiry: 0$"
13235,"Yeah, they killed it off right quick.  Just pointing out that they *technically* had an e-commerce platform.  Briefly."
13236,"bro can i have some credit for coming up with this first or inspiration? i made this back in march lol, and the dumbass wsbbot wouldn't let me upload it:  https://youtu.be/PnhysCA2gnw"
13237,I’ve never seen so many paragraphs. Sorry I’m too retarded to understand.
13238,"Just to litigate on behalf of evil defense corporations that will never love me back. Maybe if this shit really moons though, I’ll re-think my shitty life path. Thanks for the note brother."
13239,I’m not gonna pretend I read all that but the first few paragraphs while listening to “liberation - sound melody” that Spotify put on for me made this a nearly erotic experience and now I have to buy some GME   Thanks OP

Because those are only fit for people who have ultra low focal length corneal implants or retards with Bubbles Syndrome.  Then again, saying you'll watch it from the front row if you're in this sub might mean you've actually got the blue membership card."

13244,"Lost it at ""market price."""
13245,"Once Jim Cramer reads this post hes gonna sell his house, sell everything dump it all on GME calls."
13246,Ooh. I like me a crock pot.
13247,You must endure till the end. The VFX team really flexed their muscles during that last race.   Ok don’t endure some people don’t like things and that’s ok. But if you can handle the game Rez I recommend anyone willing to watch a movie about cars that partakes to please give it a try.
13248,Couldn't agree more.
13249,"Write a book, Sir."
13250,Speak for yourself. I bought KCAC when it was at 24 and sold for 120.   Should've bought more to start with.  When it drops back down to 100 I'm going to rebuy all my shares.
13251,"Get it over 32 please, then I can sell all my shares for a profit."
13252,i was just in complete awe of what was happoening i just stared wide eyed and mouth opened and wondered what the fuck was going on and why the fuck was everything so pretty. and that fuckin monkey dude. that fuckin monkey
13253,Jack Black was in a Speed Racer movie?
13254,"watched it before acid. watched it during acid. havnt watched it since.  i specifically chose that movie to watch during acid because i had seen how intense it was before acid and figured ""hey this will really break my brain if i watched this movie on acid"" and hey guess what it does break your brain. just massive overload of visual stimulation.  made it maybe 1/3 through until my wife, who was also on acid, said hey i cant watch this anymore lets go check out the back yard. so we did that instead."
13255,Thanks to all you autists for making the work weeks seem much more doable. Cheers to all!
13256,all this talk of locking the doors on boomer corpos and setting it all on fire...johnny silverhand? is that you?
13257,Beautifully written. I hope Jim reads this. I bought my first ever call for Jan 29th strike $33 right before today's market close. Your DD sounds good about big happenings in March and I kinda wish I bought April now instead. I have some shares though so going to hold those either way. Thanks for writing this.

13260,"Positions: 400 shares @ $5.50. A handful of $6c 6/18/2021       Amyris, Inc. recently won the 2020 Best of What’s New award from popular science for their PureCane product. It’s a sweetener derived from sugarcane through a patented process. See more information here:       https://finance.yahoo.com/news/purecane-revolutionary-sweetener-derived-sugarcane-140000757.html       This is one of many catalyst that will continue to push this upwards as news spreads. This isn’t a new meme company so it’s under the radar, but look at another positive catalyst here:       https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amyris-closes-50-million-strategic-130000911.html       Yeah that’s a 50m deal with 30 of it payable by 12/30/2020, and this is only one of MULTIPLE transactions in the near future. Also, while I was looking at the share statistics which are quite interesting, I came across this article:       https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395271-amyris-is-setting-up-for-monster-run       Which was outlining what had caught my eye with the share stats (fourth paragraph down), amongst other really positive news.      I had no actual price target until I saw the seeking alpha article. I knew things were looking good from the recent deals and watching the order book for the past week, but this was all the confirmation bias I needed.      I get $15/share by taking the $9/share mentioned in the seeking alpha article, multiplying by 2, and subtracting $3. Easy maths"
13261,"I was gonna say this reminded me of how bad the movie was buy, I guess I'll have to watch it again since the autists love it lmao"
13262,"Wild read man, I even had to strap my helmet on for that one  GME gang, 4k shares now and holding"
13263,Hope you are holding for tomorrow
13264,Damn he’s such a fucking cuck
13265,The current board sure as shit isn’t. That’s a cohen play if it happens
13266,This is so beautiful
13267,I am so hard right now. Please do more of those. Holy crap that was good shit!
13268,"It's fantastic - I think the bad reviews are because unknowing people went into it expecting what you'd generally expect from a racing movie, not a *Speed Fucking Racer* movie.  Having grown up on the cartoon, the movie exceeded most of my expectations, lol."
13269,"Oh I see, so like it doesn't matter if it goes up X amount because it can drop back to even or a loss? What's the benefit of buying options then instead of just buying the stock? Also thanks for answering these."
13270,"I know you're the OP, but comments like this can get you booted to r/investments real damn quick."
13271,"I think it succeeded at exactly what it tried to be, which was a *Speed Racer* movie. The expectation of being ""a racing movie"" was from the non-SR fans who were going in blind expecting a normal racing movie, but instead got a ridiculous anime clusterfuck."
13272,Had you watched the speed racer cartoon before seeing the movie? Because it seems to me that people who hadn't were expecting a typical racing movie but were disappointed when instead they got a speed racer movie.
13273,"Option can increase 50% when the stock (underlying) increase only 5%. This is a random number but the idea is, you buy something that can go from 0 to infinity, and that moves much faster than the stock.  Imagine like a big large car vs a small scooter. The scooter will turn so much faster than the car, but it can also get crushed with zero protection."
13274,such an underrated movie. this felt so good to watch
13275,That looks like it might be the worst movie ever made
13276,Idk if I should buy shares or but calls. I don't ball out like the big boys here but I would still like to get in on the action. I'm unsure if this will get lost in the sauce but shares or calls? I have one contract already April 30C.
13277,Red shirt dude near the end has huge knockers!
13278,I would be forever in your debt if so kind sir.
13279,WHAT A RIDE
13280,Comoadderal.   Dude fking mixed three uppers and railed a line down a staircase of 80 steps
13281,You really think it won’t dip again? 🤔
13282,I got my shares at $13 and I’m trying not to FOMO another few thousand at $20 in case it starts to drop again lol
13283,Their website looks like a flyer.
13284,"I wish I could read so I can study this beautiful manuscript without having to put it into a text to speech site. This is brilliant my friend. Retarded, but brilliant."
13285,That's how I see it too. But I somehow can not imagine for Ryan Cohen to not have calculated this risk in. What can he do agains the bears? Buy more shares to drive the price up further or am I missing something here?
13286,we did it reddit
13287,It has to be bordering 7 by now.
13288,"FUCKING BRAVO.   I’m just a cynical GenX retread, but I’m all in on GME because of everything you said. I want to make fake money into a real win, just like those fuckers who run  the rigged system they built.   WSB owning a huge slice of the float - if held with tenacity - isn’t crossing the tracks for a rock fight against ‘hubristic rich fuckheads’, it’s more like crossing the Rubicon carrying a banner."
13289,I wouldn’t sell at only 99% either
13290,nokia and ericsson...god i held for so long just hoping...pleas
13291,Fucking hell I actually read all of that and even the articles in the links. I must be fucking retarded.   So anyways. I’ll buy more...
13292,So I'm guessing I should roll over my February 24C into April 35C if shit will go down in mid March
13293,"Yep - take the 50%, rinse and repeat.   Take $10,000 and exit at 50% for a take home of $15,000. Do it again with $15000 to $22,500. Take home 50% one last time from $22500 to $33,750 and you've effectively made a 237.5% gain on your original investment of $10,000.   But yea, definitely wouldn't be the same movie if he got out of his car and went home to chill after finishing only half the race.  XD"
13294,"&gt; Who the fuck would   Can I introduce you to corporate middle management, a class of people who have been rewarded not for vision or compelling products, or creating a unique market experience, but for maximizing a cell on a spreadsheet, and running people and customers into the ground to turn $1 into $1.10?"

Positions?  Anyone?  I want to play a game."
13304,Way more confident on the 50 but I can see the 45 hitting too if I get lucky
13305,"The most underrated movie of all time.      Although the ""more like nonjas"" joke still haunts me to this day."
13306,"Jim cramer gonna read your thing word for word on air and make himself a boat load of money.   And damn, Ryan Cohen would actually text before he comes over? Well played well raised boy."
13307,"Sure let's play. You looked at numbers but didn't look at intent.  So the very fact that in my *hypothetical* scenario we're exiting at 1/2 the usual exit point of the typical YOLO investor commonly seen here on WSB since as OP inferred, they're often bag holding in hopes of hitting 100% or more. So the very fact that we're sacrificing the YOLO dream to a more significant safety net means we're already reaching into the realm of a diversified scenario.  Hell, let's keep going...since I was agreeing with OP that sometimes we must scale back our expectations to something more reasonable, in this example by going from $10K to $30K+ over several trades instead of just one, then let's just go ahead and infer that we've already accepted the fact that we should diversify our risk to 1-3% of the overall net worth in a trader's portfolio so that going to -100% won't wipe out the entire value of the account.  And this post by OP or by myself was never intended to be a discussion of ""well what are your positions?"" OP based his video, well done I might add, based on the emotional roller coaster of losses and gains experienced in a trade. Same as a casino. The WSB porn we all love to watch doesn't care what you bet on, we just like watching the line go all the way up or all the way down.  If you want actual symbols, you picked the wrong post for that."
13308,I've never read more than 5 words on a reddit post before this... and I read the whole fucking thing (while googling half your vocabulary you uaed). Amen and God speed fellow rocket kids. To the mooooooooon baby!🚀🚀🚀🚀

13316,Not a chance in hell anyone on this sub read through this entire thing
13317,🤷‍♂️ There have been some big fat double downs at key times. Right when everyone hears RC is buying more? Shares available to short goes from 900k to 150k. Suppress the surge up for a day. Gaining 2 days in a row? Cue the now infamous 2:13pm 64k puts in one drop today. It honeslty looks like the plan is scare everyone out anytime big momentum is incoming. Only thing I can say is 💎🙌
13318,"So if I’m reading the external links correctly, shorts are 300% of public float, but only 35% of outstanding shares. Is this not the missing potential “back door”? I.e. Shorts have a deal with non public shareholders to sell?"
13319,I’m honestly willing to buy more at $22 after reading this but I wouldn’t mind a little dip to load more.
13320,"Imagine writing a doctoral thesis length post about anything on reddit, knowing no one is going to read past the fourth sentence, and thinking that you are less retarded than Jim Cramer."
13321,"I don't gamble, and I didn't invest until a few days ago. I don't have much to work with, but I just bought $250 worth of GME. I'm still learning to crawl here but I gotta start somewhere. Time to start turning these scraps into tendies!"
13322,I believe RC becoming an insider has killed the “use the proceeds from the squeeze to do a buyout”

13329,"Based on my understanding, which could definitely be wrong, I think he could sell the amount below 9%. And by mid Feb, he’ll have held those more than 6 months too. But I don’t think he’s planning to sell.  Think he wants the votes."

13382,Morning! I’m looking to do a tiny yolo on some calls. Buying 5 CLDR 20c 2/19 and 5 ENG 5c 1/15 and have around $360 to play with.   What should I run with?
13383,There seems to be something to the idea that a lot of hedging goes on overnight
13384,My pp hard with these premarket. Im waiting for a pull back on gme but it seems that moon is the way it is
13385,I’m a man-bear-bull.  Half man half bear half bull.
13386,Dont think so he wants to be rembered as the greatest
13387,You’re also very bad at math. Welcome to wsb
13388,So No Stimmy? Or more Stimmy? I donnk what to do
13389,"Welcome, would get you a drink but your username seems questionable... well who cares call me when your in zurich"
13390,Everything is going up. Imagine being a 🌈🐻.  Solitary egg in shambles 😂😂
13391,"ICLN is the safest Biden bet. That shit is going steadily UP for the next 4 years. The only hiccup will be the runoff election on the 5th. If Georgia votes Blue that will add jet fuel to the moon mission.  Current positions:  Jan 2022 leaps on ICLN, AAPL, SQ, BABA, BA, AAL, NCLH. Will probably dump AAL and NCLH today and add something with less IV."
13392,All good. We just carry on pumping on rumour and never sell the news because it never comes.  Mango man is a genius.
13393,It's better to ride the bubble up then trying to time the burst.
13394,"Good on you gme gang, rooting for y'all on the sideline"
13395,Congress has 9 days to make one simple change. ( give us 2k instead of 600) before the relief bill is auto passed. But will they do this? Probably not.
13396,"""What are you doing Mango Man?"" says Mango Woman in a deep eastern europoor accent.   ""I'm giving them one last pump"" says Mango Man as he closes Breitbart and /pol/ to open twitter."
13397,Damn... this stimmy shit is still going on? Lol... couldn't convince me this was a viable plot to a c or even d-movie.
13398,"If TSLA could just fly to 670 or something, that’d be great. Do it!"
13399,I feel the offload at open type of day. So probably opposite lol.
13400,50 + 50 + 50 = 150%      Never seen a stock with a 150% increase? checkmate bear
13401,"I just finished reading ""Trading in the Zone."" It definitely mentions a lot of the mistakes that I make. I more or less make money when I stick to my rules, but I always get pwned when I stray from them. According to my rules, now is not a good time to buy cus I know I'm gonna get burned if I buy calls."
13402,500 shares at 9$ sold se last month when it 19 will sell some today let the rest ride to 30.
13403,AAPL pleas fly again
13404,"It’s far out, man!"
13405,"Cuz of our holy trinity of bourbon, horses and tobacco.   And states aren't elected speaker, senators are.   But, it's true, hillpeople are dramatically overrepresented in congress."
13406,"Well they did say they wouldn’t leave for Christmas break until a deal is done, we’ll see if they consider it done even if trump won’t sign"
13407,Musk saying yesterday that Apple turned Tesla down was a Titan brain move. Completely reversed the trajectory of TSLA and removed the so called ‘Tesla bubble’.
13408,Why did JPM manipulate silver price down?
13409,i might consider buying FUBO if it drops down 40%
13410,TRIT on a moon mission and yall missin out
13411,Oh man new thread. I'm actually deleting all of my posts soon but..  But like two seconds ago this guy was begging for an award from elon on the old thread and I told him to stop being a bitch and I got some gold.  Have some dignity even when you're posting on the internet. That's a good rule to stand by. I wouldn't say anything here that I wouldn't say to someone's face. And I can say some pretty weird shit. Just uhh.. be confident in your weird shit.
13412,There was no way if Tesla got bought by Apple they’d be even remotely what they are today crazy how shit works out
13413,"ARK funds, clean energy, cybersecurity. See y'all at the lambo meet-up."
13414,Cheeto man just being professor chaos now and it’s hilarious.
13415,I was there. I saw it. Someone gilded you.
13416,"I buy spac’s and sell monthly covered calls to make my cost average sub 10, can this go tits up?"
13417,Yeah. But today it looks like Apple messed up massively - transferring the power from Apple to Tesla.
13418,"Respect.   I started with some candlestick TA books. Had money of those ""light bulb"" moments thinking of mistakes I made in the past.  And yeah when I lose money these days it's normally when I stray from my rules as well."
13419,"Everybody saying buy GME, puts it is then!"
13420,40 is a bit late.
13421,Do you guys know why markets are called bulls or bears?
13422,"The stimulus check isn't $600, its $1200  You do have a beautiful trophy wife, right anon?"
13423,What a weak ass stock. Dump it
13424,Nothing happened to it it’s been moving sideways like this since the last push. 3%?! Are you new to volatility?
13425,"Take the loss and move on, like i did. No point staying there with a market like this."
13426,"Okay so yesterday I posted, “If nio breaks 49.50 its going to 57” and it honestly didnt age well considering if did break 49.50 except it fucking tanked all day. Maybe todays the day we see Nio back passed $50"
13427,"Wakes wakey, It’s time for skool! C’mon man."
13428,"It's the way they attack. Bulls thrust horns up, bears swipe down.  Or, because WSB  Bulls r chad autists  Bear r gay. And r fuk"
13429,I'd just buy NIO Thursday EOD for Nio Day run-up
13430,"Imma let you boys in on a little secret...  In 2016 and 2017, Nancy bought about 3 million worth of AMC shares, and hasn’t sold them   AMC isn’t going bankrupt folks"
13431,Trump can't veto.
13432,"Diversify a bit man, get TAN and ARKG too"

13446,"This stock has indeed a lot more upside potential than downside. Furthermore, Pfizer's vaccine has only got 74% efficacy on *asians*. Should be doable right?"
13447,32% premarket right now. lol
13448,"Def possible... either way there’s gonna be movement.  The upside is huge though. Even if there’s only a 25% chance of both dems getting in, that means you need to earn 3:1 on your money at minimum to make this play worth it. If the dems win, these calls will be 10 baggers at the minimum."
13449,"Wait a second, so I can lose my money even faster now? That's some good shit."
13450,I have May 30/45 debit spreads. I usually don’t have such a large spread but IV was so high it made sense!

13453,Wtf i checked couple hours earlier and it was at 1% pre-market. Should I still buy if its already up 20% at 9:30?
13454,100 calls when it dipped to 26. Then it didn't go up. 8k down the drain
13455,"Jokes on you, I'm all ready in!"
13456,"This was a good boomer pick before the announcement, I'll be watching close and might start a position on the tsx."
13457,"I opened a position at 45 and I thought it wasn't cheap because when the pandemic hit, went down to mid 20s.  After that I studied the findamentals, and opened a good position"
13458,only know it’s São Paulo time (so D.C. time). I’ll be following Governor Joao Moria’s media feeds as he’s bound to boast about the efficacy.
13459,"It definitely isn’t, I’ll see if I can send the link to the Federal Authority for vaccinations website."
13460,Ok I will buy. Ty  So 4.5k. whats ur total port value brw
13461,"so one $30 million contract makes PLTR increase by 1%, that means $500 million added in stock value. The mind wonders what if hundreds of $30 million contract would be signed?"
13462,I first got in at 29.99. Then then the report came out and bought in again 23.75. Then bought again at 27.18. I sold half of my 27c 12/31 two days ago for a  40% profit and I'm letting the other half ride as they're down again after yesterday.
13463,"My total portfolio value??  It's in euros.  About 70K/80 in stocks and 85K/100K in commodities.  Largest position Palantir at 17, 505 shares  Visa the second, 38 shares at 190$  Ant the third is Magna"
13464,"Main concern is account protection going from 500k to 20k. But yes, for 50euro YOLO retards it's great news."
13465,"Well atleast your in the green lol. Not that I am worried, if it Dips again like that I will not hesitate. Either way im looking to hold for a minimum 3 years and if it is continuing to do well ill hold for longer."
13466,Moderna big drop yesterday  Pfizer drop too  The very smartest know we can't keep up with mutations?  Looking for excuse to strip naked and run around town babbling unintelligibly please confirm smart people.

13472,"I'm looking to load up on more PLTR stocks, but currently it's priced at $28. Think it'll dip down again so I can pick up more?"

13475,It's been on the dip for the last month. If you didn't buy in when it was at 24 or 25 recently I don't think it's going to go back down there again. but then again I have been saying that for the past month and it has...
13476,"I think its valuation is ok, but the news is a pretty big potential revenue stream.  Look at their customer list.  https://www.magna.com/company/company-information/customers"
13477,I legitimately don’t think my heart can handle any more of this elite GME memes my phone is starting to run out of rocket emojis neeed more fuelll need more memes 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
13478,This is the 3rd bad DD thread in the last 24 hours saying Sinovac is still using the Dynavax adjuvant. Not sure what is going on here.
13479,"do it anyway, sinov has short term immunity from 3 minutes of research I just did, gonna need lots of jabs to keep asia vacd and they'll be folded into production, i have no idea what I'm talking about but trust me on this one"
13480,This is spot on.  Well done sir.  Well done.
13481,"When it comes to pot stocks: Buy the rumour sell the news.  Anything that relies on government will get botched. Experienced this pot burn during the Canadian legalization and although there was money to be made, it’s easy to get burned"
13482,"Yep high risk high reward baby. They launched a satellite under licence with AT&amp;T in April 2019, AT&amp;T then signed a commercial agreement with them a few months later so I think its safe to assume they were happy with what they saw."
13483,"This happens to every spac, it's nothing"
13484,"Dynavax and Sinovac Announce Collaboration to Develop a Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine  Apr 16, 2020 at 7:30 AM EDT The collaboration will combine Dynavax’s CpG 1018, the adjuvant contained in U.S. FDA-approved HEPLISAV-B vaccine, with Sinovac’s chemically inactivated coronavirus vaccine candidate EMERYVILLE, Calif., April 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel vaccines, and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. (NASDAQ), a leading provider of biopharmaceutical products in China, today announced that they have entered into a collaboration to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The collaboration will evaluate the combination of Sinovac’s chemically inactivated coronavirus vaccine candidate, with Dynavax’s advanced adjuvant, CpG 1018 ™.  CpG 1018 is the adjuvant used in HEPLISAV-B® [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted], an adult hepatitis B vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dynavax developed CpG 1018 to provide an increased vaccine immune response, which has been demonstrated in HEPLISAV-B. CpG 1018 provides a well‑developed technology and a significant safety database, potentially accelerating the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Additionally, CpG 1018 is manufactured using a highly automated, robust, scalable process capable of producing the large quantities required in a pandemic.  “The breadth of the global healthcare community’s efforts to develop an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 has been enabled by the prior research and investment in infectious disease understanding and prevention,” commented Ryan Spencer, Chief Executive Officer of Dynavax. “A collaborative approach across multiple technology platforms enables us to demonstrate the potential for our adjuvant to lead to a safe and effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19.  We hope the prior clinical experience and significant safety database of CpG 1018 will enable a rapid development process for a coronavirus vaccine.”"

13486,So what’s the play?
13487,They start with cheap contracts that grow over time as companies become dependent and use more and more. It is mutually beneficial not parasitic.
13488,"I cringe at the amount of regret people are going to feel if they sell GME early, or worse, don't buy in now.  Gonna make me actually feel good about selling out of PLTR when it was at 11.00."

13490,Where do see it’s being announced today? I can’t find that info
13491,It is worth keeping an eye on for the next few months.
13492,"The link says that they are producing an alum adjuvant vaccine, but doesn’t say that Sinovac is producing the adjuvant. There is no evidence to suggest that. Dynavax is producing it, as far as I know. I admit, I’m sceptical about the biotech market. Some idiot tried to pump this yesterday and deleted his post. I decided to do my DD and the evidence is that Dynavax was the last company named to be producing it. The link you gave didn’t say whether Sinovac or Dynavax was producing it."
13493,"More good news! Fuckin great, it's gonna be a red day."
13494,"lol, you do you. No point in trying to convince people who are only looking for confirmation bias."

13545,CLVR is superior to all stocks you mentioned. Weed grown in Colombia &gt; weed grown in USA and Canada. Just look at their [investor presentation](https://samcospac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SAMA-Clever-Leaves-LOI-Investor-Presentation.pdf).

I’d love an early January surprise like CELG getting bought by BMY in January 2019. These major deals (Celgene, Allergan, Alexion) have an average take out premium of around 50%.

13604,I had a dream last night that PLTR was re valued at $500 per share. Let’s go!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
13605,I was short calls right before earnings and got cucked after earnings. I jumped ship immediately cause I’ve seen it before. Stocks that pump on strong earnings don’t usually come back. Good luck my man

13636,💉💉🚀🚀 injections are similar to rockets hmmmmm
13637,"Don’t buy PLTR calls, most likely you’ll get fucked by the sideways action. Buy shares."
13638,Should have averaged down a bunch when it hit $22
13639,"You son of a bitch, I'm in."
13640,"It’s going backwards again, I wish they could stop after the opening bell every day."
13641,Fair enough. I don’t day trade and I’m not skilled enough to time anything. I just jump in and hope a bigger whale will let this lil shrimp ride the 🌊 🌊🌊

13651,"Yeah for some reason every time PLTR is red my wifes boyfriend comes over, it’s really strange"
13652,Noon question - what app are you using for trades?
13653,This fucking chart only consist of dips and doesn't move anywhere.
13654,"Then buy the dips, all of them. It's pretty simple."
13655,I’m gonna pretend to sell all my shares and hopefully that resets the app and delivers us our tendies.
13656,What are your leap positions?
13657,Oh yes....pump that RTX!
13658,"Look I will solve this for you. I'll go buy, then it'll tank, then you can buy, then it'll tank more, then I can buy more! Ready?? GOOOO."

13662,Same boat dude  Got fucked really hard with PLTR calls  Good thing I had a shit ton of cybersec calls and I'm only down 5k now (used to be 15k)  Thank you Russia
13663,No its not!!! Not selling!!! Fuck 🌈🐻🥒 PLTR will buy me an island with bunch off hookers on it 🤣🤣🤣🥂
13664,Lol that isn't boomer shit
13665,"Yeah I’d consider this boomer television. The quintessential gem x show, early 90s Simpsons, was basically made to lampoon shows like Perfect Strangers"
13666,"No it’s not all good, there are literally hundreds of people rolling their eyes at you and I’m the one who actually said something. Get in early, get out late. You are misunderstanding the potential of this company..."
13667,I'm already out of margin &amp; money to buy the dips. I've buyed all the dips I could already. AND ITS STILL FUCKING DIPPING EVERY FUCKING DAY
13668,I don’t care what hundreds of people think. ✌🏻
13669,When Cohen appeared it gave me goosebumps
13670,"It may be time to put that mouth to work behind the 7/11 then, bud."
13671,This is what I'm banking on. I got in for 10 at 15.38 and sitting nice at the moment. I want that sweet dip so I can dump my entire stim check into it. WE GOING TO THE MOON.
13672,$22 is early even without a squeeze.
13673,This might just be the most amazing thing I've seen on reddit... Granted i haven't been on WSB for long but still..
13674,"I won’t lie, I shed a tear."
13675,Back to where it was almost premarket yay!!
13676,🧻🧻🧻🧻 Toilet paper hands never make hundred percent plus on profits.. Have a good day.
13677,Yeah I'm really hoping to just break even on my 12/31 28$ C's
13678,"Yes, I bought these a month ago when it felt like PLTR was going to the moon."
13679,Same and to make it worse I sold my 14.5 gme calls two days ago out of fear and the very next day it's starts to pop.
13680,"I am right there with you... we need a 10K stimmy direct payment, 3 candles and Santa to bring tendies today for it to moon before noon tomorrow!"
13681,"ughh, I feel you man. I remember when it drop just after earning report to 12~ish. IDK what happened I got busy with IRL stuff now I look back at it today boom 21~"
13682,"Dang, that sucks. I had some GME which I sold when the crash took it back to 12. I’ve the worst kind of paper hands."
13683,His calls are worth $46. There's nothing to roll over.
13684,"I wasn't paper handing, it's just I exit calls 2-3 days before expiry just to be safe and avoid any loss. Also when I sold my gme calls they were dropping so I got out before losing but had I held... Yeah it sucks but oh well."
13685,"What is the point exiting if you are 80/90% down? That’s where I’m with the PLTR calls, only thing I’ve 50 of these, so kinda total loss. Well, some other day."
13686,There’s no way these memes aren’t being presented in meetings at the hedge funds
13687,Going all in tomorrow’s pay check
13688,I wasn't really down on my gme calls when I exited really.
13689,"Another day, another contract and yet the stock stays the same lol. It's going to be big in January for sure 😎"
13690,"I think it looks very promising. Xavier Niel and Matthieu Pigasse have a track record of successful SPAC IPO's, and 2MX can benefit from the fast growing and attractive organic market industry, which is benefiting from structural shifts in consumer behaviour. Stock price is currently at 10 euro, so it didn't take off yet."
13691,"I see, makes sense. I speak from my experience of losing all on calls. Sad."
13692,Yeah it's kinda sad. It's a personal strategy I use after I went through a sadge experience with some of my initial call options.
13693,Can somebody please explain why game? I play games and haven't been in a game stop in years
13694,"Luckily for me even though pltr is kinda hard fucking me, my mark calls are saving me and keeping me in the green."
13695,Facts. Television shows were all a wee retard had.
13696,"I have no fucking clue what GME does,  but i'll put my end of bonus on it ! 🚀🚀🚀"
13697,There is bound to be a lot cause this is from my time and I’m pretty much a dinosaur in WSB terms.
13698,All LOTR are reserved to PLTR sorry not sorry
13699,"u/Haupt91 well done, nostalgia engaged hard, thanks for reminding me I’m old AF"
13700,Could go very high in a short period of time. Maybe $150
13701,"Apha flopped after the merger, are you sure that Tilray isn't the play instead?"
13702,Fuck. Best DD yet.
13703,"They might actually not show up en masse. They think the election is stolen and moreover they think the Governor and Secretary of State are part of it (both are Republican, btw). There is seriously a movement for Trumpists *not* to vote in the runoff.   I’m not sure that will actually happen, but I think it’ll end up a split. Right now the polling is that each candidate is within half a percent of the other...so really anything could happen."
13704,Go find yourself a spin cycle!!  What the hell does that mean?  Nevermind!
13705,not a loss until you sell
13706,EB Games = Canadian Gamestop. We have to save Gamestop for all the Canadian kids up north!! Only thing they can do in winters is play video games!!
13707,This movie has all kinds of gems 🤣  “It looks like you’re wankin your crank”
13708,Posts a 28% gain
13709,"I said this in daily thread and I will say it again in full sentence:  Shorters on GME getting desperate so they don't end up homeless by Jan.  They're already resorting to calling it a pyramid scheme and all kinds of dumb shit; GME is not a fucking SPAC, they aren't like Nikola selling a pipe dream for years. Their change to a digital platform in this climate is inevitable if they want to survive. Forget analysts, just think of that fact how much people rather pre-order games online but can't, how much people who don't want anything physical just buy games from console game stores instead.  https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/  Just sit with us retards and watch shorters lose everything here like they did with AMD."
13710,Yooo. These are starting to get out of hand. I love it!
13711,"nah, dems are gonna win, they are moving tons of people to vote there"
13712,All ready All In
13713,Game stop fucking scammed me when I was a kid
13714,"I upped my position to 4,500 shares but have covered calls on all of them for 30 1/15/2021. I’m paper handed so don’t trust me"
13715,But you fucking loved it
13716,You can buy warrants now which have similar leverage
13717,One contract early on is worth much more than the value of the contract itself... it also signals greater ability to secure revenue in the future and bodes well for the trajectory of the company. In other words one 30m contract means a lot to a company's value at PLTR's stage than one 30m contract when they are a $100b company.
13718,"Beautiful, just like irl. You deserve a knighthood"
13719,"Every couple months there's a ticker that moons, and looking back there was really no doubt it would take off. I've missed almost all of them cuz I'm too busy REEEEEing.  Not this time"
13720,just sell this shit and use that $46 for a BJ
13721,This is why I have picked up mad TAN puts for Jan 15th if dems lose which they somehow almost always do and picked up far OTM weed calls. I can’t lose since I am playing both sides *taps forehead*
13722,So I’m up $1600 on GME thanks to you retards! Do I take my tendies and run?
13723,Etrade only charges 8% per year for margin.  You should recoup that in 15 minutes.  Dd: I got that by raiding 8 to the -2/3 and taking that fraction of an hour.
13724,"Damn it, why'd you have to post this? I'm trying to get some work done but no way I can pass up a LOTR GME meme. Nice work!"
13725,I mean.. might as well right?
13726,"Op messed up, forgot to tag this as DD. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
13727,Did I just watch DD in movie format? OP is a certified genius.
13728,Wasn’t there literally an episode of this show where they got in an argument about using some extra money to buy T Bills?
13729,puts or calls my dumb ass is so unlucky I'll buy puts when it's insanely overbought and it will moon
13730,where can I get me a box?
13731,"Every night I go to bed I tell myself ""no more margin, and I mean it this time.""  Every morning I wake up my margin has increased because rh knows I'm retarded so I mainline coffee and WSB.  You son of a bitch I'm in"
13732,It’s even better than I remembered:  http://perfectstrangers.tv/episodeguide51.htm
13733,Thought it was going to be a roach clip.
13734,"Wow, congrats autist, you lost out on $17. FrEe StOcK  Just buy in. GME going to moon and you can buy in right now or dwell on selling a free stock"
13735,Don’t you dare be that retarded. Diamond hands all the way. I’m up $11k and continue to hold.
13736,"I’m already jacked to the tits in NIO and PLTR, but when my next check comes in I can throw it in and get more margin. I’ll buy in"
13737,"Tons of post on this subreddit about it, just search GME. Or, miss out on the trade of a lifetime because you’re too autist. Your choice"

13741,"Anyone's guess. 50-500. That's what has me most stressed out. There's no stress about whether or not GME will rise significantly, it will. Finding an exit point and making sure we don't miss out on gains is the hard part.  Good problem to have though."
13742,"Multiple exits. Get the orders in now, good till cancelled. 50, 75, 100, 150, 2000"
13743,I honestly dont **buy** that **PLTR** is going to reach 30$ EOY because these **shares** are way overvalued atm. Sell **now.** Cause when the **bears** wake up we **are** all **fucked**.
13744,Headline almost makes it sound like a win..
13745,It looks depressing as fuck
13746,"Talk about a flashback, jeez"
13747,congrats even if it will go to 36$ tomorrow you will still be at -90%
13748,Can you read? It said OVER 50% and they haven’t even had the damn conference yet. Give them a chance.
13749,F
13750,I would love it if in the Jan meeting they announce they’re taking over a majority of SolarWinds contracts.
13751,"So you think it's 90% effective because they announced it is over 50% effective? Time to sell my calls, getting too irrational."
13752,We will see later today.
13753,You would have made a lot of money with puts.
13754,"22 is early with or without a squeeze. If you don't see a squeeze by $40, then sell out IMO. But buy NOW either way"
13755,This could only have been created by someone in a very specific age bracket. I approve
13756,"Better be that $2000 Stimmy, people want there money so bad they don’t even care how much the government fucks us"
13757,"try praying to another god, if pltr jumps tomorrow it should be $37"
13758,Just a daily reminder that if you buy your calls at least 6 months out this won't happen to you.
13759,*Press F to pay respects
13760,that's some grade a meme right there.
13761,Jerking under $29 all fucking day long...  A lot of calls sold. So they will beet the piss out of PLTR to stay under $29 till market closes tomorrow. Monday fucking Andromeda! $33 Premarket

13763,I have 12/31 27$ Cs... needs to go up a bit. Fucking annoying!

13769,"I bought LEAPS for Jan '22 ($40 strike) and Jan '23 ($32 strike). Will look to stock up on shares after the lockup shares are released and buy that dip. If there's no dip to buy, then my options are lookin' nice."
13770,"There was a significant period of my life where this was my favorite TV show. I doubt it holds up, but it was cutting edge comedy at the time."
13771,you don't make or lose $ til you sell. HOOOOOOLLLLLLDDDD
13772,"Well no shit, sherlock. The stock went up 10% today and we all made tendies. Always buy the rumor and sell news."
13773,I just wish theta decay didn’t mess up my may calls. Nowhere near worth the same as the initial bull run.  😞
13774,TAN is up almost a 100% in anticipation of biden winning senate because green new deal. No senate TAN sells off. Biden gets senate legal weed MJ to moon.
13775,I ain't no bear lmao but yeah after I get rid of these calls I'mma but leaps and shares and just wait.
13776,I legitimately thought this was a joke. But GME is going to the fucking moon. You god damn autists

13782,Almost done with being edged are we? Well they can keep this going longer until you explode because your options expired worthless just under the mark. It will likely hit $30 at the end of January.  Hope you can last that long :)
13783,I didn’t have any options 🤷🏼‍♀️
13784,yes I am which sucks because I can't watch my trades.
13785,Heard something like they serve a couple dozen customers right now. When they boost that 10x cause they are public now!?
13786,Been since the start of corona and before that lmao. Didn't even get a stimmy either
13787,It’ll print. People need to get in before Jan run up to tech demo and Q4 financials
13788,Can’t believe I’ve become a boomer for having watched Perfect Strangers
13789,I want it to drop again so that I can buy in and ride the rocket back up.
13790,This is one of my favorite movies of all time
13791,Keep away from the Canadian LPs they ate cheap for a reason. CGC is higher priced only because they have STZ behind them . Cronos because of Altria . American MSOs are the right yolo
13792,What a fucking awesome ending 😂 nice dude!

13799,"Cuz day traders, retard. You think GME will hold a 150$ target price after PS5 and future consoles are old news? PLTR is going to break and run. GME dont know shit about custom tailored AI driven algorithm data solutions. They have the market by the balls but very few realize it right now, ask Airbus. 💎 ✋ bro. This aint gonna moon overnight"
13800,If WSB is the justification for GameStop's existence? Well......
13801,Three days after next earnings I believe. But also just read a good argument about how majority of stock is still owned by founders and VCs that won’t be sold at lockup end. Apparently employee stock options don’t account for enough for it to make too big an impact so BUY BUT BUY
13802,So above all the emojis?
13803,Wow I thought the only episode I remembered had something to do with Balki having to sword duel otherwise his ears got chopped off and put in a box (but later I think it was confused for an ear of corn but I could be mixing it up with another show).
13804,"No options left, but I have a couple hundred shares I bought at 15"
13805,I would actually buy puts way out to money to show you how much Dems are losing this.  To me there's not a a chance in hell they win this.

13811,You probably don't belong here with your sound logic and all
13812,Okay guys. What’s the name of the movie. Will watch it during Xmas.

13858,Not really about the veto. Its how he laid it out to the public. Now its a politically risky move to vote for the bill as is. What politician wants to tell their constituents they voted for $600 and gender studies in Pakistan when the Presidents wants to give them $2000?  Pelosi and major dems are already on board with changes.
13859,"The problem with that logic is we are talking about “you” being one whole unit. And one whole unit cannot be over 100%. Even if you gain 100% body mass you aren’t, technically speaking, 200% you. You’re just a bigger you but still 100% you.   A stock is a whole unit. But like your weight, it’s price is not. So while a stock’s price can raise in value by 150%, the share  cannot be anything other than a share.   Where does that leave us? Stonks only go up and you’re a fatass (who’s bad at math)."

13905,Is it too late to hop in
13906,You did it wrong. Who were you hanging out with?  Most of the people I smoked weed with are either dead or in a halfway house.  They were also not that great of people.

13917,"I'm gonna post this once only.   Why is nobody here even aware of Telos (TLS)?  IPOd shortly after PLTR, The S1 mentions PLTR as a competitor. Long standing government contractor. They have government contracts with the FBI, DOD, CIA and others. Government agencies just renewed this year more highly lucrative contracts with them locking in profits for 5 more years. Their tech is highly entrenched in cyber security departments throughout the government and military. Highly increased demand this year especially after the FireEye leaks and Solarwinds back doors. The mission for 2021 and beyond is to break further into the civilian market.   Revenue is 1/3rd of PLTR yet 1/30th the market cap and they're profitable.   It's on you now if you sleep on this."
13918,It’s probably because Apple Mention mvis in one of their patents related to their car. Only reason it could dump is it for some reason Apple announced a different company got their lidar contract or they steel mvis intellectual property which is a possibility.
13919,"For a quick play, I don’t think so."
13920,"Lots of memes on the table. QS, M VIS, GME, VLDR... I think I’m too late to all of them tho"

Fuck, do I sell enough shares to buy them back and still retain a larger quantity of shares? Any chance it goes back to $18 today??? My ass wants to puke over this, apparently."
13925,"That's the beauty of options, you're not late to price movement ever."
13926,That's what I'm doing right now but it doesn't do much for my body or any other positive aspect so it's really a no go  Or at least it should be
13927,Don't think so
13928,"Trump tweeting about more stimulus, Dems calling the bluff.. you're move turtle."
13929,"man, they've been some of my best plays.  i'm a dumbass and i don't know what's going to happen up/down but i really think it's going to move=strangle.  sell the one that crushed it the next morning and hope for a reversal and unload the other one."
13930,Bro I just spent like 20 minutes reading on there. Crazy how much some folks are suffering
13931,You acted like a 🌈🐻and then got 🌈🐻 results and wonder why you ass wants to puke?
13932,Don’t eat tabs w dicks
13933,"&gt;Mr. Trump’s aides said they view his comments more as the president voicing his displeasure with the bill than an actual veto threat. If the president doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 10 days after it is passed, it would become law without his signature. If he does reject the bill, Congress could still vote to override his veto.  WSJ  So even if he vetoes the bill Congress can still send it through. But with him dangling the 2k 🎣 now how likely is it that congress pushes the bill through with only $600 making them look worse."
13934,"Stimulus checks not being signed -&gt; potential GME pullback? im looking for a juicy entry in to gme maybe we’ll see like 19.5 market open, although 20.8 ah is pretty mad"

13939,I bought a giant leap on GME just yesterday as it happens
13940,"I sold those calls with the intention of using the premium to buy more shares, lower cost basis, and buy back after theta was SUPPOSED to eat them alive this week so I could reap maximum tendies because I'm 🐂"
13941,They were offhand friends for years and became consistent friends through a shared love of music. Then I kinda figured out what was going on and it hasn't been too happy every since.

13948,"I was(am) with the nerds, lol!   I was mostly joking, I did abuse it in highschool (smoked before class) but now I smoke like some drink a beer at the end of the day. helps me relax."
13949,No options silly. I don't have the capital to park into a stock like some value investor I need leverage FDs treating me like a back alley hooker
13950,Too late to go all in on ALPP?
13951,I took a lot of Ritalin and dexamphetamine and applied for special consideration for exams in college for a ‘mental disorder’. Had to hustle that degree. Think the stimulus abuse has actually fucked my brain
13952,Bear r so fuk
13953,"No, you buy my extra shares so I can buy back some of these calls and keep more shares for myself"
13954,It has no price ceiling if they get commercial operations moving without any safety issues. Vertically integrated so there's a big barrier to entry for any competitors to do the same.

13958,"I know WSB really hates them, but PFE actually has pretty good dividends."
13959,"Yeah. People who start drugs in highschool are the kind of people who won't go far in life.  Now, people who start drugs after college, there's someone who's fucking crushing it at work and just needs to chill. Hang with them cuz they're about to invent the next Google"

And I think I'm pretty fucking successful considering. Have fun but be safe about it. Don't be afraid to ask for help putting some distance between you and a particular drug.  Also, don't forget to sober up for a day or two every now and then. Just like Bob Ross said, gotta have the dark to remind you how awesome the light is 😎."
13962,I hadn't fucked with it yet and was looking last night. Thanks for reminding me.
13963,&gt;f Tesla got bought by Apple they’d be even remotely what they are today crazy how shit works out  ARKG   G stands for GANGSTASHIT

13970,Finally found GME and microsoft/ xbox collaboration info.  Very GME bullish possibly T bullish as well [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqgamn5mjQg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqgamn5mjQg)
13971,Apple could actually do something. They're 5 years too late now though.

13973,"$31.5m contract. Hey i am in on pltr...but what is that, like a five day contract? 31m blows around on the floor now when they meet to talk about real.contracts lol"
13974,Bruh she is a fucking boss that's why'
13975,"Sounds like you weren't expecting the price to rise that much. I had the same issue last week and had to eat a loss to prevent my shares from being called away. Lesson learned, if I expect the shares to go up, sell puts against them."
13976,"This happens a lot to me selling covered calls, I freak out but then remover theta is your friend, if there is a pull back today, theta will burn even more of the price and it is a short week, if it is a red day look to buy back closer to end of the day, let the price melt down a bit, he’ll even tomorrow at open might be even lower, even a little pull back would help you"
13977,"Go ask theta gang sub, we're all just happy our calls are in the money"
13978,They have a vr system coming out?
13979,I speak to a free therapist and I couldn't even imagine mentioning to him anything about those drugs even though they never really had any sort of effect on me that I would consider to be recreational. They almost made me slow down because of how fast everything was going. But again... my therapist is free and I've already told him I have problems with alcohol. I doubt he even has the ability to prescribe something like that and I'm afraid to even ask.
13980,anything less than +10% is a red day for QS
13981,Wait and see
13982,Just buy in a bit each day over the next week. Nobody knows what will happen but there's a good chance it just keeps mooning
13983,Low volume melt up today
13984,FB IV being at ~35% makes me want to buy very badly
13985,Makes me 🤔 of all money I basically lit on fire with RKT calls
13986,"Yeah I'm hoping it moons, but the dividend is like a participant prize everyone gets"
13987,It's not my fault I can't stop eating
13988,Buy a long near the money call
13989,You need a psychiatrist to prescribe it
13990,"hey man bro dude, I'm rooting for us.. I just think it's not going to move much till January. I hope I get to eat my words at close though!"
13991,Exactly why it might work
13992,So sell and get gained
13993,You're
13994,I fucking hope so. I’m balls deep in calls
13995,"Is there any ticker with a posadist CEO or board chairman or something, or just any ticker that aligns with posadist values? What play would be good praxis for a posadist today? I'm not a posadist I'm just an ally to posadists cause they don't have enough help in the world. I'm kinda just speaking up for them trying to see if they have any representation in the stock market"
13996,"Bois, I’ve worked hard this year, today I take a holiday and enjoy the company of you fellow degenerates. Whats your biggest play? Let me know!"
13997,I don't want to be a complete degenerate but selling a FEB QS $100p and buying 7 $100/105p would be a hell of a play
13998,"It’s ok I may lose half my shares to covered calls :) it’s like I sent my wife to McDonald’s, but at least I’m still on the plane"
13999,"No one knows. Hence, shares. 3 mil dude has been 💎👐 for months."
14000,Holy shit that’s a game changer thank you
14001,"Did you really just mansplain percents to us  It’s a joke, holy fuck."
14002,"Taking risks.  In life I take big calculated risk, I try drugs that I've never taken if I believe they're from a safe source, I got into stock trading without a lick of knowledge because I knew the companies would do well.  It's about making educated decisions confidently and being able to bear the failure, it wouldn't be the first time I got fucked up and ended up sleeping on the bathroom floor, but it doesn't bother me because it is an expected outcome.  Also a nice weed sesh once or twice a week helps a lot with my mental state, makes me focus, resets my sleep and it's like hitting a button in my brain that releases all stress of the thousand things life throws at me.  Stronger drugs have not worked for me because the shift to normality is too large, and it feels paradoxical but I like to be relaxed when I do something that requires a lot of concentration."
14003,"Don't give up, you will regret it"
14004,I think of it more as they got $150m contracts in the last week. So 15% of their previous annual revenue in a week.
14005,Yea a good place to put money if you wanna keep it safe
14006,I had one GME 15 Jan 20c. Bought at 0.23 and paper handed immediately at 0.27. It's not a lot of money but still hurts ;_;

14009,"No, you have to understand political theater and coalitions better  If he vetoes this bill, since Nancy and Chuck jumped on the narrative, it now looks like they’re in the positive. There is no more old stimmy “dems failed discussion”. Now it’s cocaine Mitch in the spotlight if it doesn’t happen.  You’d need a veto proof majority to pass it if he does this. The dems never go outside of aunt Nancy.   Donny is trying to stay in the limelight. It’s a good move, but damn he is fucking his party by doing this right now"
14010,Dividend is what a company does when it can't come up with something useful to buy and grow like a real company.
14011,You’re afraid to your own dreams? Don’t eat so much cheese. I think it was the zinc in cheese that spawned the correlation between pizza and bad dreams. Look it up. Maybe you’re taking zinc as well I know I am and now that I think of it my dreams aren’t that crazy so maybe it’s not so big a deal
14012,"With Unions involved at the traditional automakers prices aren’t going to be competitive, and they move too slow. See Hummer EV"
14013,Friendly reminder to anyone thinking of buying QS calls today.. a 135 call exp 12/24 literally has -4.05 theta....just ummm. Don’t buy those calls lol IV 230+%  just overall not a good idea even if it does have another 10% day
14014,Wow I’ve already made more money PM on ICLN than I lost the last two weeks.
14015,I could probably get in to contact with one but I'm very weary about even bringing it up to my therapist. I've already told him about me not doing well with weed and alcohol so I couldn't see him even attempting to connect me to someone who could actually get me help in that regard. Even though those drugs aren't similar at all.
14016,Apple all day

14030,Nah it’s a room temperature IQ play. The only people falling for it are the idiots who managed to be dumber than him.

If this isn’t enough proof of a bubble then you’re a goof  QuantumScape Is Now the Second Most Valuable Car Stock In America -- Barrons.com  12/22/20, 11:00 PM QuantumScape stock's epic run continued Tuesday. Shares closed at $131.67, up another 39% after rallying 29% on Monday. The numbers are, to say the least, incredible.  Shares of the electric vehicle battery company have gained almost 80% this week and about 593% over the past three months.

14270,"I've read about this. Does it just mean I can carry the loss forward to claim it against my income, or is it carried forward to calculate my gains for the year?"
14271,Our government is seriously beyond retarded.   Imagine not giving people 2k like 2 weeks ago...it would have been pumped back into the economy immediately with CHRISTMAS coming up.   These are the people we leave in charge. 🤦🏻
14272,PLUG forever on a moon mission
14273,A safer way to do that is get the options half way thru the quarter for the expiration date that falls after earnings. I’m a degenerate as well
14274,"You are not wrong, but we still got 2 hours till open.  I am bullish, but did buy a few cheap puts to hedge against a big profit taking day."

14280,Fuck aapl go up
14281,You’ll have to use it to offset some capital gains at some point.
14282,The thing that worries me about PLUG is that it's such an easy target for a short seller hit job
14283,U have calls? Then I’d go with 107
14284,I'm so ready to buy high at 9:31 a.m. and then feel like shit at noon.
14285,"advice please, I have a 25 strike call till feb 19 for the BYND alternative T to the T C to the Flying F, does it make sense for me to continue holding &amp; when should I sell it, this fucking counter is seeing weakness premarket, I need some assurance LOL"

14288,Except I'm not a cash rich cat and can't afford to take him to the vet yet. This is literally a poor person problem. I'm at a big low here my dude.

14297,Are SPACs dead?
14298,I declare bankruptcy! TSLA is down premarket so I guess this means my long is dead
14299,This is not the way. Are you lost?
14300,Shhhh don’t tell Citron
14301,I did about six and a half hours ago
14302,can't really yolo shares tho just buy some shit and hold it for months. Also you can't buy the news unless you want 10% gains or some shit. Buy some shit nobody heard of
14303,AAPL $150 end of day
14304,4k back into GME a little after open   Only question is what date
14305,And a retarded mango.
14306,QS can lose 70% of it's MC today and it will still be overvalued.
14307,To be honest I don’t know how to calculate estimated theta burn. I’ll have to read there.   But IV on July 21 calls is like 3-6% depending on which strike price. Can’t be too mad at that.
14308,Says the guy screaming about 0.15% green futures  Well done.

14311,Im telling ur wife now
14312,A week and a half of people taking profit and shaking out paper hands should be enough for GOEV - time to moon you whore. 🚀🚀🚀

14314,"In out, in out, shake it all about. You do the hokey cokey, Log in log out, check discord app. That's what it's all about!  Oh HC2, Curio, Aerpio, Ocugen if it dips, Guardion and Jaguar Health and SG Block if its dips more. And yunji for 300% wishful spike someday."
14315,"just compare to the rest of the alternative meat sector, if it's outperforming and the other stocks are above 150ma it's all good"
14316,I’ve been eyeing it since start of December. Might as well jump on it.
14317,And it’s less risky picking the etf. But you might sacrifice profits if you pick the right individual stock. This is WSB so take it as you will
14318,"As in, if I’m right you’ll get permabanned or is this a no lose game for you?"
14319,Just another reason why I reject all the California travel assignments lmao

14323,"NVAX has dipped due to concerns re the new CV mutation being immune to the vaccine. This is extremely unlikely, so nvax is in a good position to bounce back quickly.

14328,Gonna drop like a rock at open
14329,Isn’t iv for July calls at 50%? Not 3-6?
14330,It’s happening in icln and ARKG
14331,they still have the same PSX for sale if you want it. It can play your CD-ROMs
14332,noobs dunno I can just get myself unbanned so they fall for it
14333,Hope you bought that a while ago not this week lmao
14334,"Nice one, i completely missed the PACB rocket.. got some SRNE/CRSR/Frog to ride into January (thinking the market has a correction sometime then)"
14335,💎🙌🏽  Those fuckers don’t deserve tendies
14336,Boomer stock now.
14337,You really think no one else will have solid state battery tech by then lol. Toyota already has solid state tech as well. QS will crash and burn back to like 40 eventually
14338,Is it too late to add more GME?
14339,Plenty cool but being on the S&amp;P means mega runs are unlikely in the future. Basically they reached the end of the game all high level and shit but no more dungeons to conquer.
14340,"man, I feel like a retard - I have ford, disney, and nio"
14341,Let’s see where it opens 😂

14357,I can tell you that I'd be permabanned if it makes you feel better.

14360,any of them. All of them
14361,Any second now. Buy Dailys  🚀🚀
14362,Yeah I was up bigly at one point and idk what came over me. Just pissed away my money convinced I would win big. Literally full gambler's fallacy mode. It's okay tho could be worse
14363,Def not.  Claim the 3k losses and hold stocks til Jan 1 min.  Double it next year then you’ll be dandy.
14364,Then unemployment numbers are no good because shit shut down again.
14365,QS has swung $10 already. Can’t decide. I’m scared. Hold me.
14366,Which days are holidays for the stock market this and next week?
14367,Or it solves the battery/fast charging problem and is undervalued
14368,Anyone bagholding FDX? Hoping I didn’t get in too early ..
14369,Buy high sell low 💎✋
14370,Vague FB post
14371,How is no one talking about all the people mango pardoned. He distracted all of us with the shiny 2k stimulus
14372,So what are the unemployment number expectations? It pisses me off they keep saying V shape recovery but keep fucking lowering the unemployment expectations. That makes no sense. Fucking shitty analysts.
14373,some ppl have taken the bet that's been rigged against them.
14374,We had a big red day this week lol

14381,"I need 133+ or my calls are bust, yo"
14382,It's been on a downward trend since the beginning of December. Vaccine being approved did nothing for the stock.
14383,So the new direct listing rules means SPACs are dead right? What purpose do they serve now?
14384,Trump a real nigga
14385,Do we think plug continues it’s moon mission to 38 or should I just take profits   12/31 38c
14386,Are you talking about WSB specifically? Because that’s half of the content I’m seeing on Twitter right now
14387,Mark Benioff of Salesforce (CRM) named CNN’s CEO of the YEAR we are going to Tendie Town hope u bought calls
14388,I mean... They won't have reveue for 5 years. How do you value something with zero sales? See NKLA and SPCE
14389,No it ain’t
14390,"They might, but QS had their own patents and already plans to license it. Toyota will likely keep their technology in-house for their cars."
14391,I just looked at yahoo finance  [yahoo finance ICLN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ICLN/options?p=ICLN&amp;date=1626393600)  Where do you see 50%?
14392,So glad I took an L on Moderna yesterday morning right at 9:30. This thing is cliff diving.

14394,"I have a legitimate crush on Cathie Wood, what do I do guys? Im only 19..."

14400,"I got fucked on a couple of space that rocketed and then crashed post merger, I guess Ill do the same with this one"
14401,Wich one? Deepvalue or sir jack a lot?
14402,"I have lots of shares and only felt comfortable selling $40 covered calls for that date. I think it will go up but there might be resistance until it pushes past ATHs in the mid $28 range. I thought we'd see $30 then a pull back into a renewed push. I think there is room to move on that price. Do you have the $2500 to exercise? There is always the chance it fades as the FOMOs that moved in for a quick buck leave but the fundamentals are strong and I like their products as a long term vegetarian. They also have earnings in early February I believe around the 9th so you won't lose a lot of IV until late into the contract. It depends how long you are holding, what you need from the money, how much you've made, and do you plan on exercising."
14403,gonna make a new ETF comprised only of all the ARK ETFs
14404,It needs to go on a run for your calls to print
14405,I am glad that I bought shares instead of calls so I have no choice but to hold
14406,Yo anyone think $bidu is a good play?
14407,I can’t send the picture but on robinhood if you go on calls for icln strike price $35 July 2021 the IV is 50%

It could just be that they are more behind the scenes like you said, but I was happy with the profits (Like I said, been holding since early FEAC days), and was worried enough about the actual usage that I decided to get out. The reason is probably that I don't play mobile games like you said. If they branched out into console or PC gaming, that would be huge for them."

14764,"Look at dkng after the merger. This is doing the same thing. It will shake some people out and then pump. Add if it hits $18s and chill. This will be huge.

14798,Why play ebay when theres like 50 other hot ass fk stocks
14799,"QS a yoyo it's probably going down again and then beck up again. Perfect volatility play, do puts now, sell them and then switch to calls.

S is the 19th letter of  the alphabet.   **SQ** : S - Q : 19 - 17 = 2. It's a positive number so SQ will be positive today.  **QS** : Q - S : 17 - 19 = -2. It's a negative number but QS will be negative today."
14827,"Daily reminder that he didn't.  He sold, then it made headlines, and those headlines were the catalyst for like a 25% drop   Dude got out at a great time. Not sure why everyone feels the need to pretend buffett is an idiot."

Politics is so fucking stupid. It shouldn't be this hard you retards."
14841,I think that’s too many steps to cause a reaction now. The news headlines will be about stim not weed stocks. Also it’s not like the dems automatically win if they block stim.

They accuse landlords of ""making money off earth"", but they then want to live in a house they are not paying for completely rent-free, which is funny to think about.  So, I can't pay for this land and make money off of it... but you can move into the fully built &amp; maintained house for free and use it without paying anyone... hmmm.... unique thought process there."

15555,If it bounces you may be able to time it right for a day trade.
15556,Wait... NO revenue??? They exist just to spend money right now? And the public investors give them money with no expectation of returns? We have to pitch these people a stake in r/WSB.

15567,IV is still a bit high and they still have last-gasp pumps once in a while.    ill just watch it wither and die from the sidelines.
15568,Probably too poor after shorting TSLA from 400 all the way to 695. He and chanos reduced their position around 650 which is hilariously bad timing.

AD 600). This era was immediately followed by the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine period. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the Archaic period and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin.

15667,pltr is the worst case of opportunity cost i’ve seen this year tbh  december was a skyrocket month

15669,Y’all degenerates really believe that gme is going to hit 100+?! How’s that possible?

15680,"up 80% on N N D M, cashing out at open and throwing that shit in ICLN"
15681,Five bong rips deep so far
15682,Lol CNBC is right. Adding Tesla to SP500 was like adding yahoo back then. It’s like we don’t learn.
15683,does cathie wood's wife need a boyfriend? i think i'm in love
15684,"People are buying the $550 earcans, people are gonna buy 5g dlc car too."

15692,"Well PLTR isnt quite crashing. Come on baby, rocket to 30 🚀🚀🚀"
15693,I would start making bad choices if I did. I don't have enough liquid cash to make clinical decisions if my bills depended on it. Maybe in a few years if I catch some breaks.

15700,Sounded to me like they just did their initial ACH deposit.   I remember it taking a week to get options bp. Promptly lost $400 on 0dte SPX options on a FOMC press conference the day I got access.   Good times.
15701,"RH is easy to use and has free commissions, that’s why I started with it.   But they have basically nonexistent customer support, as well as normalized crashes at market open.  RH is a broker for 12 year olds and anyone who likes their money stolen."

15710,AMD Gang didnt deserve this.
15711,Why so many people here focus on PLTR for weeks when there have been plenty of stocks that went from 20 to 40 while PLTR sits at 25

15713,Malls are getting turned into condos now.
15714,Appl car my ass. That shit won’t even last a few hours on one charge 😂
15715,NKLA literally lost a trash contract. Does it make them trash if they can't haul trash?
15716,"I don’t have any more positions in it, I just know the sum bitch doesn’t move"
15717,"Ok I understand, so we sacrifice 100 NKLA bulls, and the Wall Street gods will make tendies go brmmmm?"
15718,Meg Tirrell looks like a ghost
15719,"Boobs are for homo's... if you never had a girl sit on your face, then stfu"
15720,No idea. Haven’t talk to my accountant yet
15721,They had NFLX on the ropes and they blew it!
15722,Calls on Amazon Q4 earnings. They are going to destroy everything.
15723,i need to get out of F. My 12 yr lesson from FNMA is not to get in to any stock that can be taken control of by the government
15724,Today could be a slight pullback just because of yesterday's skyrocket.  Still could be looking a little further down the road before we Moon.
15725,And my gf isn’t getting railed by random dudes off tinder ... bro stfu baba is trash
15726,Brilliant. Didn't even know of this! JPM's YouInvest platform doesn't let me purchase leveraged ETFs. Am already in the process of switching to TDA..

15731,u/ElonMuskOfficial - Don’t Doubt Ur Vibe

15746,Our day will come soon brother and we will laugh at anybody who didn’t listen to us
15747,I lost over 6k on that 300c lost month. I was making money til xi said “anti trust” in the PM  and pretty much lost everything over night. Learned a expensive lesson on why it’s bad to put a lot of capital on a single option trade
15748,"I have to piss, should I hold it until 9:30 for good luck?"
15749,Oh . Think a lot of us are lol
15750,Every year they release a new model starting with no wheels for stability. Then no engine for decreased weight support.
15751,GME holders will remember bears advising yesterday to sell and buy back cheaper today.  Ain’t no cheaper. Lesson: don’t listen to bears. Bears r fuk.
15752,I’ve got shares at $15.68 CB. Sold a 3/15/21 35c against them last week. Not really liking the idea of being assigned so I may buy calls and either sell them for a profit to buy back my shorts or to cover the shorts if assigned.
15753,Don’t get everyone excited - need to roll these fucking calls
15754,Shit has me hard as steel
15755,"Of all days, today is the day to be a gay bear. Market is more fragile than some of you on this sub lol"
15756,Condos &gt; gamers &gt; Gamestop... right?  This mall is in a hick area. They'd be better off renting spaces as hunting blinds and letting animals run loose through the building. Would make a killer return. Pun intended.
15757,See you in Mars GME🚀🚀🚀
15758,"""isn't quite crashing"" is kind of downplaying being up like 2% PM don't ya think lol"
15759,Not a fan of the premium on wish options.

15761,"I literally liquidated my entire portfolio including all my QS, PLTR and GME stock (I don't do options) on Monday, hoping to just close my positions and have a nice Christmas and take my measly 5% yearly profit. I missed out on the biggest gains this year. Somebody please comfort me."

15793,I mean she can be a sexy ghost
15794,You still made money - a lot of people here are red for the year.
15795,No idea. Can’t even get a new console in person either
15796,That usually means you're about to lose your ass
15797,Yea bro you might want to explore other trading subreddits or watch YouTube video that actually go in depth about options I wish I had done it sooner I would’ve been profitable quicker
15798,"[SEC approves direct listings, removing the traditional hassles of IPOs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-nyse-idUSKBN28W2D4)   Does this mean spacs are no longer needed? Will the ease of direct listings inflate this bubble forever? Are we now on an eternal bull run??"
15799,FDX done dumping? This could be our moment! 💰

15811,buy pltr now
15812,What's the outlook on all these BABA lawsuits?
15813,I've literally been chanting this to myself for the past several days so much that the words lost their meaning. The loss of opportunity is more painful than any real loss I made before. What is wrong with me

15820,It is a reflection of us.
15821,I think the car is to avoid getting labeled a monopoly. They are a ‘tech’ company vs a phone/computer company. Google is trying a similar thing.

15823,Don’t jinx it🤫😬
15824,bought ICLN at 16 and it’s been awesome
15825,Why are people saying CRSP?? Any news ???
15826,"Lol. Yeah.  I also like market order options to close on the other two.  For liquid high volume options, easy to get out.  rH takes like 30 seconds to prices and then it's too late"

15835,"I'm not worried about PLTR that much, it had that explosion up to 33.50 and needed some time to cool off. It's been tracking steadily upward and above the 8 EMA since the pullback. It's safe as long as you have LEAPS, stocks, or ITM calls"
15836,"Well obviously you’re retarded, if you think 2k during a pandemic and main st. economic Armageddon is a bad idea."
15837,Aapl
15838,You underperformed SPY500? My man... give it up and just buy ARKK.
15839,I have no skin in the GME game but I really hope you autistas are right about this one and ride to TendieLand  GME Jan 21 35c

15855,My cat’s breath smells like cat food.
15856,Can you work it?
15857,I bought KMX calls at the bottom. A $2000 stimulus would be nice af
15858,Penny stocks popping off this week along with penny stock shills in the sub like crazy  Careful folks like that DD said this is when MMs unload their bags on you for the year so they don’t take a loss
15859,they have 31 employees and are valued at $14B lol
15860,"Let's see what the IV is at open. Yesterday saw IV in the Jan and Feb 25Cs get crushed by 50%, so premiums are cheap right now. You could get the same calls for 30% less than if you bought on Monday. Best to scale in with volatile stocks like this. Lot of SPACs dropped on merger date though and then rocketed and doubled. That's what I'm playing for here"
15861,"Hey cuckerberg, I don't mean to rush you or anything but I do have a large part of my portfolio betting on a swift FB recovery.  Thanks in advance"

15868,T H C🐝 never even formally announced its EV acquisition in their SEC filings and just asked for an extension at the beginning of December.   WSB is truly retarded for buying that shit.
15869,you now officially can trade options on my emotions when PLTR fades by open
15870,"I agree, it’s absurd"
15871,You like it

15882,Are markets open tomorrow?
15883,"Trick was to get in on SHLL early and ride it up to the 50's, sell, and then turn your back like Voltron while it exploded.  Turtle gang will probably be okay once SNPR gets something to bring to market."
15884,BYND has been going sideways too long. I want my money now. PLTR at open it is.

You give up cause the stress is killing you and get out for breakeven or a small gain.  Only to see it rocket a few days later.  Freakin kills you man.  We've all been there.

16004,FCEL is about to blow up this is your earnings tards to hop on a real tendy train
16005,hey i’m not a GME shill. I’m just passing along the message. They are trying to get away from their current business model because of where gaming has been trending for the past 10 years(finally they realize.)   They are likely dead imo. They are way too late

16180,It’s crazy how similar their voices are. Swear I was listening to Marv last night
16181,Thank god SLG rebounding
16182,ARKG at open.  Its AH high was 109.  its at 108 and its underlying stocks are up.
16183,There are idiots in here that actually believe we're getting 2k lok

16188,Well you sure can you just gotta give me stonk that go uppity
16189,Time to take my $2000 and turn it into $600.
16190,Yeah I feel like that’s part of their gimmick. They don’t want you to be able to sell at the top
16191,"Im not one to tell you what to do, but again if you aren’t grabbing GME shares, do you even like money or are you that guy who gets a hard on from losing it?"
16192,You know QS will just do a another 30+% up today right?
16193,"Hold for a good while, into late Spring easily, is my plan."
16194,Not sure. I didn’t think we’d get this far
16195,Aren't they doomed to live in the shadow of starlink? I don't have much faith in that..
16196,The hard truth: you wouldn’t have to diamond hands today if you had ICLN cause THAT SHIT DONT DIP
16197,Consume more soy. It's great on noodles
16198,where can I look what institutions hold a stock?
16199,That’s many months away. The world is about to learn the power WSB can have on a 1 billion dollar company

16210,PERI and MGNI gapping up big again. You love to see it
16211,Still the right move IMO because yesterday could or could not have happened and more likely than not FD's die out. Long hold / LEAPs are much safer and still pretty good payoff
16212,"Fuck, was really hoping to get it at a discount."
16213,IANAL but it seems like it is going to be difficult for the DOJ to prove that Walmart had a policy in place to accept prescriptions that they knew were not valid.

If I don’t own these 200 shares someone’s going to. I’ll keep holding as long as it makes me money. My friends on the left wouldn’t agree but they aren’t gonna pay my mortgage off for me so..
16221,Yo why is jadakiss is hard as it gets?

16232,"Real question, no answer from the folks in r/stocks.   A defense spending bill is about to be passed in some form or fashion. Mango might veto it, but it has a veto-proof majority. He has until today to veto. If he does, then the veto is overturned on Friday. All that to say that the defense spending bill will be passed. It obviously budgets money to be spent on defense and therefore companies who provide things for our defense.   I’m thinking that defense companies like Lockheed will pop once the bill is passed. Am I thinking correctly here? Defense stocks DEFINITELY don’t look like they have anything priced in, they have dropped recently.  Would I be wrong to expect a spike in LMT, LDOS, etc?  Thoughts? I’m thinking of buying Jan 8 calls on a couple companies."

16255,"I have a friend that works there, definitely wouldn’t go long on this, but probs will pump again for no reason. 45BB market cap with a 1/10 chance of success, I’d say it dips a little after Feb earnings, but with this euphoria who knows could be $200 by YE.

16318,Bye GME. See you at Bikini Bottom.
16319,this mentality is exactly why it will close above 30 today... just to fuck you right in your bear ass hole
16320,Probably. Hes not exactly one to lay down amd take it when he doesnt get his way. BTW he may do the same thing to the stimulus package
16321,Trying to not FOMO today by waiting for pltr to drop in the morning as usual. So I can guarantee you guys that it will fly to 100 with no dips today.

16400,Theres no way people can be wiped out while it is still trading above $600. Refuse to believe.
16401,Either GME will trade flat for a few days and then skyrocket or GME will trade flat and then dip. BoA and Melvin execs have to meet first and decide on whether they want to cover or continue dumping money in to short it. My guess is that they will cover and take it as a tax write off.

16463,I mean on Jan 4th not a quarter of your position
16464,Already got $62k in so why not double down?  Fite me
16465,COOL/CLABF only has a test at .86 left and then it's blue skies to NASDAQ town.
16466,"GME is probably going sub 18 today, maybe worse if hedge funds put out some dump pieces like they've done every time their short position got BTFO  Yesterday was a short squeeze so these guys are probably shorting again, and are gonna use the news to help"
16467,Figured but Ameritrade likes to act dumb from time to time so i asked
16468,Just tying to help fellow autists is all
16469,If PLTR doesn’t hit 30 today and cucks us with a pump and dump again I will never trade this stock ever again
16470,"stonk will go up or down, got it, i'm in!"
16471,Turns out I want to own the stock. I only lose money if it drops below 22 f@ggot. Unlikely in that short period of time.   Stay poor.
16472,How can BABA continue to be such a pile of shit every single day
16473,indubitably so!
16474,See id like to short Tesla but I feel if I do it’ll just spike to 650
16475,Lmao I know but you can always cut and rebuy at a lower price
16476,Who trades in the opening hour? Options are super volatile
16477,"So many fucking pussies selling off AMD, incredible."
16478,Not at all. If there was any real news or reason to sell it would’ve been reflected in PM. I’m not selling shit here. They can have my shares and calls at 135.
16479,10C leaps. Theta isn't really a prob rn
16480,"Guys, boomer manipulation means buy boomer stocks! $20 12/17/21c AAL"
16481,"I can’t, I’m all in ICLN"
16482,Dude Tesla is straight up not a good time rn
16483,Yeah don‘t wanna go full retard
16484,What is up with this AMD sell off. The target price is 110! Buy the dip.
16485,If u can see the future so well then u must be a millionaire at this point
16486,&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon\_Wadi  Three minutes of Wiki DD and I'm in. Thanks g.
16487,"Buying the AMD dip today, idgaf"
16488,"Damn IV went up 10% for ICLN $23c 4/16  +$17k to start the day, expecting it to go down tho"
16489,All hail Daddy Karp :))
16490,I'm so mad lol
16491,The issue with GME is how the fuck are you going get people to buy it at $20 lmao
16492,MM whenever they see PLTR above 29   DOMP IT
16493,"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but I would buy this ICLN dip."
16494,I’m joking brother. I’m holding for the infinity squeeze true a true retard! I just put 20k into B F T - could be the next meme. Good luck out there
16495,&gt; $SPY cumulative After-Hours return since the March 23 bottom: +53%.  &gt; Day session return: +7%.  &gt; ALL the gains after March 25 were After-Hours – everyone lost money during daylight hours... in one of the biggest rallies of all time.  https://twitter.com/MacroCharts/status/1341715177507590146?s=20
16496,All of that for a drop of blood
16497,C'mon FEYE please
16498,Ever since news of Biden winning the elections PLUG and FCEL have been so volatile which has made primo options plays.   I highly suggest anyone look at PLUG and FCEL for option calls these stocks are moving all over the place
16499,Recent ZNGA acquisitions could be a great play looking into Jan
16500,and bought more GME.  what a time to be alive!
16501,Oh boy this GME BATTLE IS EPIC IF IT PUSHES THROUGH 20 AND HOLDS ITS GONNA GO NUTS.   those damn shorts cant sell forever
16502,So glad the only thing I was in was mgni lol Jesus what a bloodbath
16503,He’s lost everything by now
16504,"wtf, are they going down?no way, it's impossible."
16505,It’s at all time highs plenty of people taking profit especially with the year almost over
16506,about to? where were you last month? don't tell me you bought at the top
16507,It was a shout-out to the woke. I don’t wanna them figuring out this shit could double until I get in my leap
16508,JD has single handedly saved my portfolio lol
16509,If PLTR drops again to $27 that will be so staged
16510,"Lmao, QS now second most valuable car stock in the world  Don't get caught holding bags my friends"
16511,"Exactly. Might as well go after CVS, walgreens an rite aid too. They just filled them. They didnt write the fucking things."
16512,AMD opening red is fucked
16513,PLTR always dumps at open but the resistance it is offering today makes me think this is about to get crazy and hit ATH
16514,You guys expecting tomorrow to be a flat day?
16515,VALE calls expiring April. Are they the move?
16516,God damn ICLN making me tendies I love it
16517,Just sold my SPLK $175 calls for 2/19 that I got last week for \~110% profits. I want to see what it does for a few minutes and then roll into the $190 or $185 for 2/19.
16518,"Lmaaaaoooo   I’m so stupid! Maybe the best kind of stupid on this sub. Panic sold my SQ puts in the morning for break even price. Had I held on just for 10 minutes more (till now), they would have made me $4000 😱😱😱😱"
16519,"AMD u fuck , why don't u hit 100 before eoy like ur supposed to"
16520,"Get the fuck out with your paper hands, you know who you are."
16521,PLTR gonna touch 29 again today and then I’m out. Both my Options for eow are in strike price. I’ll take what I can get
16522,"Short AAPL a day after a rally, I’ve watched since the split, always worked! MMs kept it a boomer stock lol"
16523,PLTR's gotta be manipulated or something. If you could just play premarket or aftermarket you'd be up almost every day. Then it just dumps
16524,Feels good to buy the dip. No matter what the stock does you're still up. Only a question of when to cash in.
16525,I feel so sick
16526,I'd like to buy a call on it but I feel if I do it'll just drill to 600  Such is the story of Tesla :-(
16527,"Yep glad I bought puts yesterday :) I just sold because I think this is the bottom, RSI and Stoch indicate it"
16528,What do people think of ABCL?  Looks like a nice dip but don't want the downward run to continue.
16529,Anyone excited to get their EOY RH tax documents so they can see how much capital gains they made ?
16530,WTF is this manipulation in CRM?
16531,"Made a months salary in 6 minutes this morning, thanks TAN 🚀🚀🚀🌙🌙"
16532,Because I want it to 😭
16533,We all go down togetherrrrrrrrr
16534,Fucking CRM just dumped $4
16535,Lol this is not all time highs at all. We hit 137.98 earlier this year and 134.41 yesterday. 132 isn’t all time highs.
16536,I hope everyone realizes the insanity of thc🐝 trading at where it is rn WITHOUT a DA. Glad I got in for this ride early.
16537,It’ll stabilize and new buyers will come in. Have faith brother
16538,Worst thing is you know some day it’s gonna pop 20 dollars overnight. Oh well
16539,How is SPY up?? Every underlying that I see is down. What is up?
16540,"Citron are 🤡, look what they did to my boy LAZR"
16541,"all my positions are red today but spy still up, why?"
16542,"I sell calls to idiots on shit stocks like FCEL. You're right, super volatile=good for me."
16543,Down 4K this week so lame
16544,CRM is drilling hard!
16545,you new here? It’s literally the definition of a pump. We rotate each week
16546,Own it don’t trade it
16547,I’ll ask one more time: is there any specific reason Today of all days is why GME is going to “hit $150” (as one guy said lol)
16548,PLTR is a boomer stock now. Going to swing massively between 27 and 29 until the end of time while Theta Gang gets rich on IV
16549,Only 1260 p/e now. TSLA is on sale
16550,u hatin cz u missed out on the $4 to $20 ride? it'll definitely be over $20 by April
16551,"I’m riding a few 01/15/2021 27c’s and I’m loving it, bought the 35’s a few days ago"
16552,whens a goodtime to get in on FCEL? in 30 mins?
16553,I give it til 10 and it’s back over
16554,Selling my tsla stocks at less gains so Biden won’t get my money
16555,"Go all in , not like they shut the printing press off"
16556,Ah yes bah holding Apple again. What a familiar feeling.
16557,PLTR 😆 but ma new $31M contract!
16558,How liquid is are the WSB coffers boys? Do we have enough to save GME today?
16559,Imma take your advice and pulled out of this YOLO. It’s dropped to 118 at open. Thank you Sir.
16560,Palantards UNITE!!! Spend stimmy check now! And spend it again when it arrives!!
16561,“Palantir has signed a new two-year contract with the U.K. National Health Service worth an estimated $31.5 million”
16562,"I don't know, actually sick. Not covid symptoms though"
16563,"Currently have 200 buying power, what should I yolo it on"
16564,So NET is just gonna roll over and die now?
16565,Don’t toilet paper
16566,That doesn’t exist right now.
16567,Fun is retards say PLTR $32 today. What are they smoking?
16568,SQ is on sale rn don’t miss it
16569,we all gonna eat ✊😤
16570,"No sense rushing with GME, limit orders at $17 and $18 and we'll check back later, too much volatility right now"
16571,Jesus fucking christ I’m so sick of pltr
16572,Joe where’s it at
16573,I really wanna buy this CRM dip
16574,Hold for 5 years forget that you ever did it. You’ll thank yourself. Yea it’s boomer shit to buy and hold but this thing will be triple digits before you know it
16575,Told you MFs the sell off is coming. This is just like thanksgiving week. Half day tmrow too after massive run ups... 🌈
16576,"Fuck fubo, you’re too low"
16577,its never above the ask. it has to be in between the bid and ask.
16578,oh good I was worried for a sec :)
16579,that red dildo on GOEV triggered my but order and i'm not happy about it
16580,TSLA calls 75% off right now (source: I have calls)
16581,Ohhhh bye bye qs. My 100 p’s are printing
16582,I am by no stretch a bear but I am going to allow correction to my folio today
16583,THCB with a rocket V recovery
16584,If it breaks 20 its gonna pop. Look at how hard the shorts are fighting at $20. Exhaust that buying selling and we chilling
16585,GME April 35c... buy em while they’re cheap.
16586,PLTR is really going to fade to red at open isn’t it?
16587,aapl gonn buy it? :)
16588,v shape recovery on AAPL
16589,I bought a call on QQQ so hopefully it recovers
16590,A company with nothing somehow being valued more than company's like gm and Ford. Its insans
16591,I better see a fucking V
16592,"Calls expiring in 2022 are stupid cheap...  Not sure what gains these could grab, but it would be guaranteed gains."
16593,"as a recovering options gambler, I have to stay away from calls/puts until I make back all my losses with the aid of theta gang"
16594,I would say wait to see where it goes at the worst it will be flat today. If you don’t want to lose $32 no one will judge you for taking profits.
16595,NET dropping the most out of all is not okay
16596,"PLTR is really testing my patience.   Literally nothing but good news, and new contracts in the last month, but this bastard stil won't hit $30"
16597,Which moon was PLTR supposed to fly to today? Are you sure the bright sphere in question wasn't actually called the core?
16598,"I finally got out at the high today, I can't stand the sight of that ticker any longer"
16599,"Fuck you NIO, you suppose to be in the 50's by now."
16600,Gee thanks $T for having a Green Day after already taking my whole account
16601,I heard some horror stories from other travelers about how they try to keep ratios down. It’s pretty much the same across the board. If the hospital doesn’t have travelers you can expect 3+ icu patients each.
16602,Fuck premarket what a fucking scam
16603,"Few days, says enough if u can't have some patience though. Gl next time"
16604,I don’t touch anything till 10 am
16605,It's time. It's going to hurt but FUCK PLTR  (until you see some big private sector deals)
16606,You’re absolutely right
16607,Why is TSLA not up 10% right now
16608,well i'm gonna go for a walk.
16609,You jinxed it
16610,The market has been open rookie
16611,Yep I’m looking to pickup a 4/16 $19. Think I’ll wait for the stock to come down a little bit first tho
16612,QS112 CALL A AMBULANCE
16613,All my ITM are down and all my OTM are up. Totally legal. Totally cool.
16614,It's a tease
16615,I mean it can’t keep on going up
16616,it’s only been 15 minutes
16617,Oh ffs PLTR. Fuck this. I’m gonna beat my meat to a Lana Rhodes classic and then take a nap. See you gay bois back at 1
16618,Hope you’re not making trades based off a Santa rally
16619,hmm y'know what. never thought to think of it like that. thanks.
16620,All in on xl fleet
16621,MMs really don't want to pay out those PLTR 30cs
16622,Get out of GMe right now or you will hit your stop loss
16623,"You too man. Have great holidays. Hope your next year will be awesome.   Also, my broker doesn't sell Ark ETFs. any idea where I can find some (Europe based)"
16624,If it’s actually a leap you’re fine. 58% isn’t outrageous and you have a year to catch some IV to ride up
16625,I think there will be a number of these dump at 29-30 range over the next few months before we rocket over it
16626, Very wise.  Took me a long time to learn this lesson.
16627,Its not meme status anymore. Its just boring boomer status now.
16628,it's okay NET i can wait for you
16629,You call this a fade?
16630,Maybe cook will have the chance to get TSLA again when it drops to 1/10 it’s value
16631,"These dumps on PLTR are absolutely mind boggling.  Fucking knew I should have taken profits ASAP this morning, fuck."
16632,What is going to pop is TSLA bubble is the impatience of paper handed FOMO bois that piled in to drive it up in the first place   Also prob some fund rebalancing going on as we near year end
16633,Yup its garbo rn... but it surely will moon eventually. People sussed cause tesla is dropping... and most valuations are based on peer groups
16634,T 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
16635,"Dump all your TSLA, NKLA, NIO, XPEV, LI and buy GOEV."
16636,This is good for MU
16637,So much GUH
16638,NET has officially destroyed my account.
16639,I need a play to save my portfolio 😔 help an autist out
16640,Damn we drilling like that??? Well shieeet
16641,does it make sense to have both ARKK and ARKW or nah?
16642,bears dont realise one thing... look at everytime PLTR has dipped in the morning after a rocket PM... yes it goes up to Uranus by EOD.
16643,Gahd damn sq weeklies already a 5bagger
16644,What did jack dorsey do to someone ...  sq can’t just go up or have a normal -1% day wtf
16645,is this a bear trap on PLTR this morning or did i lose my chance to sell my calls
16646,sooo i just sold my pltr january calls for $10 profit because theta fucked it up LOL
16647,"Sell off will continue....Vaccine craze is over after approval ..so don't fall and loose money, lesson learnt from PFE"
16648,🐝 ain’t even got a defense attorney yet;    Still room on the train.
16649,You’re up 8% in less than a day...
16650,MMs shaking off GOEV paper hands before it’s rally.
16651,"it better, everything else is down"
16652,Because GME is the only thing I play with... /s  🤡🤡🤡  You're a fucking douche.
16653,So awful
16654,"If y'all didn't sell call credit spreads on TSLA on Monday, do you even trade? Shit was free $$$"
16655,come on canoo i need that v shape
16656,AI is no longer cool now huh
16657,Palantir at 6:30 grabs a giant Boulder and jumps off the cliff in midsommar every single day
16658,AAPL 12/24 bought at open well down. Can someone hand me the rope
16659,CRM .....  Not again

16663,"PLTR morning pop, drop, rally in afternoon.... It's been like this for awhile. Trade accordingly"
16664,Plug is fucking dragging down ICLN I’m so mad
16665,If GME could kindly go back to 15 that'd be great

16667,Airlines doing well. If you want to cover your losses I recommend you get in!
16668,Yeah i'm not worried. Just saying its been a bitch to hold for the past weeks. Luckily i bought low enough to survive all these dips.
16669,Lol it’s so weird seeing it green
16670,It's definitely not hitting 132 before Christmas
16671,"ICLN is allowing you to take profit, if you didn't sell at open for 150% and buy the dip right now you're as dumb as me because I only sold for 100% profit."
16672,Could always be worse — you could be a Moderna bag holder with a cost basis of $178.50. 😂
16673,"Man, TSLA getting hammered 3rd day in a row"

16681,CRM....THA FUCK????
16682,bought ARKK and ARKG and it immediately drops - whoops lol
16683,You’re an idiot if you didn’t sell TSLA on Friday 🤡
16684,Yes it can
16685,Bag holding 12/24 $134 aapl calls smfh
16686,Meh.  Buying more gme.  Avg is now 15.  Checking the sofa for any extra I can throw at it.
16687,I’m straight up not having a good time
16688,what is GOEV and why does it only have 3 employees
16689,I literally sold yesterday at a 70% loss so you’re welcome
16690,Who just dumped 1M shares of CRM at the open and WHY?
16691,If it’s holding it’s going to moon before Christmas.
16692,Lol. AAL keeping me alive today.. so far
16693,I'm running the 4/21 25$c while holding several shares to support the gang gang!  &amp;#x200B;  Wish us luck bruda
16694,Fuck you TSLA bears eat a dick
16695,You're not doing it right
16696,Pltr i can't believe you've done this
16697,From +1400 at open to like +300 now  Feels bad man
16698,I'm stoked for the next year so I can blow a load in my Roth
16699,Seems like it's dropping like all the other Chinese EVs are - tracking TSLA.
16700,Yeah too many paper hands selling first thing every single day it will close higher than the pop
16701,"Well I'm fucked, good game.."
16702,"Can SPCE go back up pls, WSB SPCE all IN"
16703,QS puts 115p/24/12 that I got EOD yesterday are printinnnnng!  Some for FUBO puts.
16704,"It’s too late PLTR, don’t bother trying to say sorry"
16705,oh yeah you gucci then. as long as Ford doesn't fuck up the new Mustang or the Electric F-150 that will hit.
16706,I might have made the best possible play in the history of my portfolio yesterday by buying 15x SQ Dec 31 137.5p  But my panicking mind made me sell them at today’s open for a measly $100 profit as I wanted to go back to sleep! Those puts are up 100% rn. Basically could have made $7500 in just a matter of a day! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
16707,December has not been a good month for COST.  It has been selling off ever since that special dividend.
16708,Goddam CRM just go to zero why don’t you
16709,"Do people that try to time to market everyday, saying stuff like SELL NOW AND BUY THE DIP LATER feel like clowns when they sell and the underlying keeps mooning?"
16710,It's a miracle that PLTR isn't red
16711,Bears are getting their 15 mins
16712,I just got cucked so hard by cathie bro. Felt way too good to see arkk at 138 when i woke up
16713,it's to hurt us before holiday.
16714,$TSLA 700c 1/29 in the building.  If there is anything about tsla's price behavior is it always shakes paper hands out with drastic drops. then out of the blue it fuckin shoots up +$60 in the last trading hour.
16715,"PLTR shall not exceed $29, even if the govt were to sign an agreement to exclusively use their services for the next 50 years.  It has been so decreed."
16716,Do it pussy. You wont
16717,oh i must have bought all of the shit you sold
16718,GME don't fucking paperhand lol
16719,If the DD threads had a mood ring the color swings would be epic. 😂
16720,Who else here bought PLTR at the literal top of that last massive green dildo only for it to dump a minute later. FML
16721,"Sell at 19, buy back at 15, sure if I knew it would happen. 270 shares at 15 atm"
16722,Robinhood needs to have a daily “You bought at the top!” Or “Sold at the bottom!” Alert. If you were within .5% of the top or bottom. Same if you were non-autistic and sold at the top and bought the dip.
16723,just say Gg to ur stocks and take the L
16724,AMD
16725,BA
16726,CRM always remembers to throw away the weekly gains at the end of week fml.
16727,Can I get an F for AI bois?
16728,Losing $60k so far
16729,Riot if it pops
16730,Don’t try to save a portfolio. If you see an opportunity then take it. But trying to earn back what you lost is a recipe for disaster.  But you can try GME puts I guess
16731,I can’t tell if this is one of those down at open or down all day kind of days…
16732,V shaped recovery incoming
16733,popping a champagne for people who bought QS at 132
16734,Yeah having a big jump for a majority of stocks like that to start the day will make me very skeptical

16788,"Interesting interview with an Amazon employee in Logic Mag:  ""The rumors that I hear, both internal and external, are that we're very seriously interested in acquiring post office real estate. The reason why the post office is valuable to privatize is because of their real estate holdings. They have great real estate in every downtown of every city in the United States. Amazon may be interested in buying all of the post office locations, and we have the cash to do it. So why not?   The other week we announced we're hiring one hundred thousand more workers *again*. We're expanding dramatically across the board, in part-time and full-time, at corporate and retail and fulfillment and logistics and devices and distribution and all the various pies we have our fingers in."""

16817,Why tf was vix even up 30-40% on Monday's open. It has literally lost all of it since then.
16818,"IV is ridiculous high right now, and shorts are probably getting desperate to the point they may well be working on some news piece about how GME is dog shit.  The problem is that they would actually be right and the bulls will likely panic because nobody actually wants to be holding GME a year from now, so why not take profits?"
16819,"Use TDA or Etrade. They charge per contract, but ive never had a contract not sell as soon as I hit the button"
16820,"don't worry, it cannot be kept down"
16821,Why is GOEV not $50 yet? I was told EV stonks are retarded

17000,See your (you’re) too smart which will lead to (too) negative tendys (tendies)
17001,look at all the retards that bought weeklies
17002,"QS Still too high imo, worth $10 Max for a company with no product"
17003,that's what i thought and the d really threw me for a loop. I'm only semi retarded. GL KING
17004,"Well yeah that's what I mean, I don't wanna see it go up any more lol.."

17006,come on CRWD go lower so I can add more
17007,put it in an etf moron
17008,Looks like the PERI secret is out of the bag. Trending now on massive volume. Hope you dummies loaded at $10 when you had the chance. Rocket ship to $30 here in 2021. Next MGNI and APPS type move.
17009,GME has left the solar system
17010,Is it 👀
17011,"i'm not sure if it's on reddit or RES, but if you upvote something it disappears from the main page"
17012,"Trying to reinvent gamestop will never work. Gamestop has ruined all public goodwill the company has ever had from their shady business practices and bad customer service. Maybe if you rename the entire company and do a rebrand you can do something, but not at the current state"
17013,******I-P-O-C******  Can’t go wrong here.. Jan 6th merger  Hop on fellow tards
17014,Come on SPY. You can get to 370. Just a little more and I can sell and have a wonderful Xmas.

17047,Once all the insiders stop selling their PLTR shares this will Moooooooooon
17048,Lol I almost bought some puts after getting fisted for a week and a half straight by T
17049,"that's nothing, we made a company that was nothing more than an EV prototype with a gravity-powered shell worth 4 billion."

17062,"Sold my PLUG calls on open this morning. Sad to do it, but it’s running a bit hot right now. I’ll be back in though! Train keeps rolling in 2021!"
17063,"AT this exact moment, if I held onto my GME Calls, i would've broken even...... (looks again at the chart)... now I would've made a profit."
17064,My GME rod is so hard. Have the shorts decided to take a loss for this tax year?
17065,"I can't believe I bought BB FDs. I mean yea sure, im only gonna lose 10 bucks but....FDs? BB?  Never get high and browse WSB."
17066,If you don’t like GME posts I suggest you take a break from this sub for a while
17067,GME weeklies are wild
17068,I don't know but I like it.
17069,Holy fuck I really blew it missing the GME train
17070,"Is it too late to get in on GME , I feel like the buy low sell high is the only thing holding me back. I feel like I’m too late to reap profits"
17071,Dipped my toes into GME. The single call I have is printing me 80% returns in one day. I’m liquidating other holdings to lean into it Meme YOLO thrusters engaged
17072,Head of Melvin capital better put his Miami mansion back on the market to cover these short position losses. Anyone got a tiny violin I can play for him?
17073,UPS and FDX have been so disappointing this week
17074,Seriously I don’t even care about the money for GME as much as how fucking fun the ride is.  It’s pretty much peak WSB meme stock. A  boomer brick and mortar store is going through the stratosphere and utterly BTFOing shorts
17075,But it’s beat your dick December. You should be up to 23 times per day now
17076,GME pushing straight through $21 like it's nothing.  DON'T SELL!!!  This shit is headed to $25 EoY.  Do you really wanna pay all of those taxes on your gainz in only a couple of months??
17077,Every time PLTR starts off green it ends up red.
17078,Can’t believe I let those idiots in the GME earnings thread foment insurrection.  Good thing I doubted but didn’t sell.
17079,All aboard!! Next stop: The Moon
17080,GEEKING SO HARD RIGHT NOW GAMESTOP &lt;3
17081,Watch XL.  It’s getting run up like NKLA did the first day of trading it’s new listing.
17082,"Fuck the GME bears, we're not stopping"
17083,ALL ABOARD GME
17084,Yo wtf is KFC doing this year?  A lifetime movie with Mario Lopez and now a console with a chicken warmer lol
17085,My only problem is that I didn’t buy more 😭😭😭
17086,lol. $10 grand now
17087,Seems like analyst opinions are more important than actual revenue-influencing contracts these days. Looking at you Palantir
17088,a shit ton
17089,Fuck you all who told me not to yolo GME and do AAPL instead
17090,"This comment will age very poorly, and I have no position in GME. Just shows the lack of understanding  still when it comes to Cohen."
17091,Tesla’s market cap shows the potential for the sector so market caps adjust somewhat based off that.  At least with something new like EV
17092,I thought it was going to dip more before 🚀 and missed the train
17093,PLUG looking good hope y’all bought that dip
17094,You're right. I missed it.
17095,O see G N  Get in while it's still cheap boys!
17096,I’m genuinely so happy for GME gang
17097,counterpoint: Breaking $21 is a glorious sight to see for GME
17098,So happy I managed to roll some of my GME April $13 calls to higher strikes on the dip this morning!
17099,There’s not gonna be any bad news cause GameStop doesn’t exist anymore
17100,"Theta is the looming phantom for us theta gang boys, you can’t always see it and it doesn’t always work so obviously, but trust that it’s there chipping dollars away and stashing them for you."
17101,I lost bigly holding a call. Makes no sense.
17102,This market is so fucked
17103,Now who's laughing.. GME gang assemble   FOMO bitchezzz
17104,ALL IN
17105,That awkward moment when Melvin Capital can't manipulate GME down to $19...  JUSTICE ALWAYS WINS
17106,GME TO 22 is it possible????🍉
17107,GME is legit doing it.
17108,Fuck yeah. We are pretty much making bank while saving the planet.
17109,"FUCKING GME, IVE BEEN LOSING SO MUCH SLEEP OVER YOU BABY 🚀🚀🚀"
17110,"Idk guys, ive got a bad feeling rn"
17111,"Deploying tweet. Thrusters engaged to the fucking moon, trajectory course set for V shape"
17112,GME joining the S&amp;P 500?
17113,"Nice, I got 3300 and making a killing selling calls. You must be banking with 10k."
17114,Why isn't it holding the gains though
17115,DD guy says squeeze could last months because it's being shorted to 0 so hard.
17116, NIKOLA the short squeeze is coming! did you not see how that truck went downhill amazing technology years ahead of anybody else
17117,GME guy is up to like 5 mil now lmfaooooo
17118,MAKE THE HEDGEFUND SHORTERS LOSE ALL THEIR MONEY IN GME BOYS   MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS  DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS
17119,"Btw, GME short borrow rate is 19.9% so this bitch is still pretty heavily shorted lol"
17120,"I gotta admit, when i bought into gme i thought you retards were talking out your ass and it would never pay off. Here we are a month later blowing past 21 likes its nothing"
17121,Dow is back!!!
17122,If tesla goes green it will a real and true Christmas miracle for me
17123,"No goddamn it, only too late if the squeeze is squoze and it's only starting"
17124,Let it go. There is always another trade to make.
17125,I love that XL is beating the hell out of Canoo. Everyone was on Canoo’s jock and XL took the back seat. But now? Ha.
17126,"I'm a simple man, when PLTR dips to 25-26,  I buy calls. When it pops to 28-29 I sell them. I like simplicity. I like tendies."
17127,"Anyone have a reason for XPEV drilling compared to NIO.  I know NIO day is coming up so likely movement of money to the 'hot one'.  The only real news I've heard is XPEV deliveries of SUVs to Norway, which you think would be pretty good."
17128,I feel sorry for all Melvins
17129,"Up 600% so far lol, sold 2 at 50 bucks to get my initial back and letting 5 roll"
17130,They deserve it for acting like there's no way they could lose. Just doubling down on their dumbass position every single week
17131,Just tell him that its not your fault! Retards told you to buy it and you as fellow retard bought it at top! Dont worry that company is gonna be grate eventually
17132,Steel stocks are priming engines for a liftoff after the new year 🚀🚀🚀🚀
17133,I can't believe GME... seems so unreal
17134,"By the end of this squeeze, this sub is going to have so many GME bag holders"
17135,Don’t forget to post loss porn
17136,Bought 100 shares of GME @ $19.91 a few minutes ago. It’s not much but it’s honest work.
17137,MGNI doesnt give a fuck
17138,"PLTR bulls.  Be cool. HOld your shares. If you aren't in shares, then buy 100+ shares of PLTR.  Buy 1 OTM p for January.  25p maybe  Then do debit spreads weekly (e.g., buy 30c, sell 32c)."
17139,Probably a millionaire 🤷‍♀️
17140,I don’t appreciate your facts getting in the way of my narrative here buddy
17141,"Arkk, arkf &amp; arkg"
17142,Santa doesn't wear a green suit
17143,Fomo'd into GME lets go
17144,YES BROTHER COMPLETELY RIGHT THEY ARE THE BEST EV COMPANY - I WORKED ON THE LINE AT GM 38 YEARS THESE KIDS WILL SEE.   -RICK
17145,Welp my entire portfolio is now GME I'm sure I won't regret this.
17146,don't look now but XL is poised to post XL gains.
17147,Ya I agree! Dont get me wrong I love the money but for some reason it's so much more aboyt the satisfaction of collectively being right and getting back at these boomers!
17148,Look at us. We are the printer now.
17149,PIC boys if you held we Eatin now
17150,"By the end of this squeeze, this sub is going to have so many GME bag holders. Greed is going to get you"
17151,It's brutal man. I thought a bounce back was inevitable. Hopefully it happens within the next couple of weeks.
17152,A compromise with SATAN smh
17153,Because it isn’t going to have any vehicles until 4th quarter 2022 which means more like 2023. I wouldn’t be surprised if this is nkla 2.0
17154,"Shares, yeah. There's a lot of overlap tho."
17155,"you can keep bitching about PLTR, or look how strong AAPL is this am.  have to say though, watching GME--that would be a fun one to watch if it went off.  I'm in for a few cheap calls.."
17156,"its trading pretty weird. dont think its gonna have the jump others did, but i really hope it does cause ive got a pretty significant portion of my portfolio riding on it"

17159,Honestly I stay away from healthcare related stocks been burnt on them with wild swings way too many times.  I think a lot of them just been hyped up now too much cuz of rona and cathie pump.
17160,Holding pretty good to me. Been in for a week. Check out ipob chart to compre
17161,If PLTR could have just one day where it doesn't dump at open that would be greeaat
17162,Not at all
17163,Lol B F T warrants just go up no matter what
17164,Literally every other stock this morning: V-SHAPE!!  PLTR: Yo dog imma just hang out down here a while.
17165,If you buy puts you can literally only hold them for a few hours at most.  It really is buy calls and nothing else
17166,A prince ☺️
17167,what's up with $QS? Was it just overvalued or is it a good time to buy during this morning's dip?
17168,whyyyyy is it so slow tho
17169,"GameStop refueling for a bit, don’t be a paper hands bitch"
17170,Still averaging down on roku cause I'm emotionally invested in this now too like all good traders are
17171,Ventured over to r/stocks and didn’t realize that you can’t say the word autist
17172,Friend got a promotion and the first thing he did was buy a car. His first paycheck hadn’t even hit yet.   Why are people allergic to their own money smh
17173,It's an EV company that's actually steadily getting contracts and partnerships. I've got a 10c for 12/21 because I know it will take time. Only other EV I'm in is Canoo also at 10c but 5/21.
17174,MSFT is so undervalued it's insane. Unfortunately they suffer from not being sexy but their fundamentals and growth oppurtunites are outta this world
17175,Extremely undervalued. It’s the perfect “boomer EV” stock. Great fundamentals and not just some dream of potential earnings. They have actual contracts and firms can save by just electrifying their fleet as opposed to buying new vans/trucks over the next few years (that aren’t even out yet).
17176,This aged well 😎
17177,Took a -15k loss on retarded QS  25k left what to do?
17178,"Ngl. As much as I wanted to be against it, the plays that have paid off the biggest for me were GME."
17179,Forget $22. We’re going to $25 eod
17180,I haven't been able to get rid of this massive GME erection boner for the past few days. Like this shit is 100x more potent than the blue pill. Looks like it's coke and hookers for Xmas till this thing goes down!!
17181,Alright you fucking retards GME 12/24 $22 bitch let’s get it
17182,Just all in Ed gme monthlys cuz I like free money
17183,I didn’t have any money but I knew I should’ve been buying yesterday’s dips and averaging my positions down. FML
17184,Is this a lot of volume for GME really though? Not that robinhood volume is ever accurate but I think it was higher yesterday at this time
17185,"What's happening with GOEV, you guys said it was gonna moon!"
17186,NCLH 👀👀
17187,My GME calls are losing value but the share price keeps going up...
17188,Abandon ship or hold??!  https://imgur.com/a/cFED2DU
17189,"At close, QS was valued the same as PLTR. Approx 50B.  What a fucked up market. They don’t wanna see us win"
17190,"Lol, omega bag holding 1/15 35/40c abd shit won't give me a decent spike to take less losses and get the fuck out! Holding 300 shares too, those i won't sell unless my covered calls get assigned (lol, as if)"
17191,"Yeah, im all in GME but really hoping PLTR and MT/Vale (fucking hate vale, trusted the unvale tesla battery day shit and lost a lot) moons too. I want us all to be happy. And i really hope people at least have some play money in gme calls. You can turn couple hundred of bucks into hookers and cocaine for weeks. Take some gains and enjoy holidays fellow tards!"
17192,NVDA has become the ultimate day trading stock every morning drops to 520 then goes back up
17193,Another low volume day where indexes only go up because the USD dies  Love these
17194,Wouldn't an OTM put mid feb be better for post lock up?
17195,Buy GME shares. It’s still early
17196,Why is the market green?  Even my oil stonks are mooning.
17197,No way I sell before we see 500$
17198,Same. Luckily I bought calls all the way at the bottom foreseeing that I would get absolutely fucked by my paper hands. Those calls made this a little more tolerable.
17199,Ford to the mooooon new promo f150 electric powered but doesn’t look as autistic as Cybertruck tho
17200,Those wanting to get in on GME. It's gonna be a long squeeze until the earnings in March/April
17201,Bro you’re gonna be a millionaire :’)
17202,You’re down 3% lmfao
17203,"Yea so its confirmed a half day tomorrow so take a minute and say merry xmas to all the trading retreads here, its been the wildest year ever and thats saying a lot for me  Hope all is well for y'all, enjoy and be well  finally, tsla in SnP, tsla out SnP, so far looks the same lol"

17208,"Man UVXY puts decay so fast. Mine hasn't really changed in value, even after it dropped from $12.20 to 11.37.   1/10 - won't make this play again"
17209,It was a statement not a question ego headed fuk
17210,Y’all slept on 0CGN
17211,It is pleas flying again?
17212,"GME, showing MM how it’s done."
17213,"Stocks that are at highs tend to run further, then throw in the super squeeze element and it’s time to ride or die."
17214,"For someone on the sidelines, what’s a good entry to wait for"
17215,What is this V-SHAPE about? I saw ppl saying same thing for AAPL too? Is it indication for downfall?
17216,I bought a share of gme yesterday at 19ish because my watchlist is too long. Thanks for the two dollars i guess 😂
17217,It's telling that I came here first to vet stimmy rumors
17218,TFW Melvin Capitals GME puts are literally down 90% 🤡🤡🤡🤡
17219,Woke up planning to buy PERI and it went up 25 percent wtf
17220,Sold the W to buy calls on the K this morning.

17230,hope you got later calls its gonna be a slow climb unless theres good news tbf
17231,It’s higher rn than it was yesterday
17232,They clearly dont know about NIO day then if they are basing it off that... idiots
17233,Possibly.  But I'll wait to buy that in a few weeks. I'll buy one put a few weeks out every few weeks is what I'm saying.
17234,FCX don’t reject $25 challenge

17244,To think I started the week off with my GME calls -90%. How am I supposed to buy high and sell low if it recovers?
17245,"I'm gonna have to call a doctor, this thing ain't goin away in 4 hours"
17246,They quiet now because we're mooning
17247,"🐝 no product  🦞 no revenue 🦤 make or break hurdle to overcome  Yeah, it doesn’t make sense to have. Worth 50bn."
17248,Put down your phone til 1030. Sets alerts if euro tanks at close. If it doesn’t we smooth sailing....
17249,Whats a retread you ritard?
17250,Don't know what allergic to money means but they sure are retarded
17251,This can't be proper movement any more from GME. Is this the squeeze beginning?
17252,holy shit lol I can see noone is selling GME and shorts are getting desperate lmao
17253,Suddenly my GME 12/24 $27c don't feel so dumb
17254,"I mean, this is a quarter of GME volume yesterday in 30 minutes. IIRC it was 24 million yesterday at close."
17255,"Not sure what refueling looks like, but up 5% in half an hour looks like a full burn."
17256,Damn even my Jan 2022 GME leaps are about to double
17257,"If he had a really shitty car, I can understand."
17258,"what yall talking bout ""mooning"" i dont see no green in my eyes bitch am i colorblind"
17259,So guys... I’m on this GME rocket ship but what do you guys think the moon price would be? When do we get off??? 50??
17260,"Fr glad I offloaded my puts at the first $158 dip. Got a 10% profit, if I held to now ($158) I’d be down 40% 😂"
17261,I can only imagine the amount of tendies you long term GME autists are making. I've way in the green just from the past couple days trading 12/24 20 c. God speed GME gang
17262,It’s almost comical with PLTR at this point
17263,Fuck it I’m buying lobster tonight thank you GME
17264,"Go for it, my wheel is breaking because I can't find anyone to buy the puts I'm selling"
17265,"I'm asking why it's drilling relative, not asking why it isn't mooning."
17266,SPY quit playing and break out into a new ATH thanks SPY 370 Cs
17267,Crm just took a fat shit on me uhhhhh
17268,WSB V EVERYBODY. GME TO 150
17269,"I genuinely am so happy for DeepFuckingValue, dude has absolute titanium balls now he’s the king."
17270,"Happy for you GME guys, y'all have taken a lot of shit. Enjoy it boys."
17271,FB/MSFT But you'll have to wait till earnings. Not a quick buck.
17272,Lmao GME is so funny
17273,Wsb vs the hedge funds all shorting GME. Can’t believe wsb is actually winning 🤣
17274,"TSLA PTON DKNG, all pumping back to 0% right now"
17275,"G,K,W"
17276,nvm i can see now
17277,Fomo into fcel and riot at open. Now i look like an idiot.
17278,You guys don't like the iCar anymore? Come on pump it
17279,Is this the GME squeeze or are we still holding
17280,"If you look at my latest post ( the speed racer video ), well when they shout at futures “hang in there”, it’s me right now when I look at GME and you guys squeezing it."
17281,GME gang hold the line and don’t sell. We’ve got these fuckers on the ropes
17282,You really gonna trust a sub full of bagholders?
17283,A shitty game store is gonna have the highest market cap by then end of the day!
17284,Don't fucking sell your GME. If nobody sells the price goes to infinity. Simple fucking math
17285,AMD GET BACK UP HERE
17286,Wowww a man nuts but GME keeps suckin
17287,Couldn't do this one week earlier hmm GME? Rip my 14/15c's from last week
17288,Gz to all of the GME playaz
17289,I hesitated to double my shares when gme was at 19.3 sad now
17290,"G, K, W"
17291,You retards really did it.
17292,So for GME I should sell this weekly and roll it into a 2 or 3 weekly for the squeeze right?
17293,PLTR struggling to keep up the momentum is now a daily occurrence.
17294,Just watching PLTR be a dick while GME goes ballistic makes me sad
17295,GME is doing it lol
17296,"I was thinking about it, ask yourself the question: would you rather have a tesla or a fisker?  Tesla's are s3xier, plus Fisker's logo sucks. Like what is that thing?"
17297,Because people are realizing the new steel prices haven't been locked in yet. Plus wood prices are skyrocketing to and cheaper to use steel (right now) in certain areas of construction.
17298,now is literally the time to buy puts....
17299,RSI and stochastic finally indicating a GME top. Still wouldn’t buy puts tho this stock defies everything lol
17300,I’ve been erect for over a day after reading Cohens 13D filing
17301,All in on GME to cover your losses!
17302,Lol same. My Chinese EV calls are shitting the bed.
17303,Another V-Shaped morning.   Who would have guessed it? Since idk it’s happened like every day for 2 weeks.
17304,"You are lucky that, this time, there is no top"
17305,"I prematurely took losses thinking it would only get worse, where almost every time, if I had been patient and waited a couple weeks or a month, I would have made a great profit instead.  SPAQ and PLTR are the best examples I have of this. GME too, I was down 20% 2 weeks ago on it and I'm still holding, up 30% now"
17306,How much pain are these gme short sellers experiencing?  This is insane
17307,GME has won.
17308,200 more gme checking in.  I remember seeing the original dd when it was like 4 bux. I was the retard.
17309,When it hits 100
17310,"Long dated ARWR calls have made up for all the other stupid shit I've done this year. Which is dangerous, because it makes it seems like some people here know what they're doing."
17311,"GME is actually on a mad one, I'm shook"
17312,"Average volume over the last 3 months is 11.67M, we're at 6.7M as I type this lol. Volume is insane right now."
17313,Hahahahaha this shit it funny to watch rn
17314,This would be the smart. I have a few 12/24 22s I’m rolling out at some point today
17315,Is it happening GME? History is written here
17316,just here to say my daily fuck you doordash burn in a house fire
17317,WE FUCKING CONTROL GME NOW BOYS!!!
17318,"&gt; NVDA   I feel like its gonna be the same with Tesla, Gonna YOYO between 620 and 660"
17319,"GME bro's 1,000 Jan 20c are now $2 ITM with about 3 weeks to go.  fucking legend."
17320,ICLN.  Ark funds.  Maybe TAN.    Feasting all through 2021.
17321,So another 3 months of this b.s.?
17322,Look at GME volume right now
17323,Can’t wait to see all that GME gain porn 🤤🤤
17324,Goddamn how much more of a bitch does salesforce have to be
17325,GME went from bankrupt to up 700% in less than a year 🤣🤣
17326,It ain't much. Aint
17327,FCEL looks bearish now
17328,GME stop! The shorts are already dead!!
17329,Hope the GME lords here don't sell off for Christmas.
17330,I’m nearly all option. I just hit 40k
17331,Can one of y'all give CPR to NET?
17332,Dude - that deep fucking value guy.... lol I can't wait. WSB singlehandedly destroying 'smart' money
17333,💎 🙌 until GameStop guy is a billionaire!!!!!!!
17334,"The same shit happening to me with other stocks, it's so annoying"
17335,"It’s been an awesome stock for covered calls, just worry it’s going to moon soon and I’ll lose all my shares. But I need to make money with the shares, can’t just have them sitting doing nothing."
17336,For tax losses... to offset the bull run since March.   Might be only reason why I imagine some shorts might be exiting.   Especially since unless you’re r/wsb level of retarded the bulk of your position shouldn’t be weighted on GME.
17337,AAPL puts for Jan right? Biggest market cap just can’t run up continuously like TSLA
17338,"right? my fucking daily chart is a skybound green dildo, the likes of which gay bears have never seen"
17339,It almost certainly will unless it doesn’t
17340,"With Biden now won and green energy coming into play, fuel cell energy is converting methane into usable energy. FCEL is the way to go"
17341,Has been for weeks now sadly
17342,Fuck I have 23 &amp; 26 GME lottos just in case it actually squeezed and I’m up over 300% on these fuckers. If only I didn’t have more than $200 on them
17343,Short squeezing a stock doesn't mean the company is actually doing well.  Remember to keep that in perspective GME bulls  Short Squeeze != Healthy Company
17344,Don’t overthink it.  ICLN is the way.
17345,Mostly big funds. It's a rounding error for them. They just delete their RH app and check back later
17346,My limit sell on GME was right before a big push up...GUH
17347,Honestly throw a Hail Mary in GME calls
17348,$NOC getting ready to trigger a reversal from months long downtrend.
17349,"I want to thank every GME diamond hander, dip buyer, DD provider, and short seller.  See you guys in Alpha Centauri."
17350,All aboard GME and SPCE we going to the moon.
17351,You are retarded. You won’t do it
17352,Then you're playing wrong
17353,Dump on nasdaq over? Now as usual up!
17354,"TSLA waking up. Quite happy with it’s performance since inclusion, was expecting it to have a big correction."
17355,Bro dont buy weeklies on GME. Thats not how you play a short squeeze
17356,Is it though?
17357,"it's 5500€, don't bully me! I'm €uropoor and not using margin ok?"
17358,"Just goes to show you you shouldn’t take your stock advice from twits on here, someone three days ago was saying “if you have any spare change just pick up GME puts” LOL if you listened to this guy sorry"
17359,Vale still a good long term hold?
17360,You can judge that based on the number of borrowed shares vs shares outstanding....  Squeeze ends when the number of borrowed shares is basically down to a pretty small number relative to what it was around 13 dollars per share.
17361,## can we get a live feed of u/deepfuckingvalue GME positions??
17362,I’m making money wtf.  GME is the real real... I’m sorry if it crashes but I ain’t. fucking. selling.
17363,I wish there was a live counter following u/DeepFuckingValue GME position. I would put GME's chart on one screen and his option on the other and grab popcorn.
17364,This has got to be the start of the squeeze
17365,It’s the shorts fucking losing is what’s going on
17366,They’re literally having their biggest quarter ever lmao
17367,Someone smarter than me tell me has short interest changed?  Are shorts covering?
17368,Glad I held my BAC call 🚀
17369,I can’t believe it. This sub is actually about to be rich as fuck lmaoooo.
17370,Love it!
17371,"I’d like to know this as well, considering getting some April calls."
17372,If only it weren’t for that pesky profitable quarter rule.
17373,"I bought $400 in GME puts yesterday, this is the perfect amount that I can laugh at myself as I’m punished but also be a lil sad. Can’t imagine how the actual shorts are feeling right now getting absolutely wrecked for real amounts of money"
17374,CRM what the fuck
17375,"Good shit my friend, you timed it perfectly!"
17376,Now GME crashes
17377,My only regret with GME is I didn't buy more shares. Only have 2600.
17378,"Why, isn't NET good tho"
17379,At the count on 3 i wanna hear you all scream on the top of your lungs  FUCK THE CITRON BROTHERS
17380,"Seeing double support at 7.40 so good chance it heads back up soon. If it breaks VWAP at 7.75, good chance it goes to 8 again by lunch but in reality who the hell knows"
17381,It’s happening
17382,"don't take profits on GME, the shorts r fuk. stay in!"
17383,One day chart is literally a giant green dildo into space
17384,A sincere fuck you to CRM
17385,I don’t know if it’s because Tesla is green after that open or because I’m taking an especially spicy shit but either way I’m crying and it’s beautiful
17386,"I’m so dumb for not buying more weeklies lol I’ve made over 1000$ by just buying cheap lottos on GME and they keep hitting, I should have had some more conviction and went all in 🤑🤑"
17387,LGVW has options now
17388,Tesla is alive and so are the 650 c’s I just bought! They expire tomorrow and I’m out of day trades.. already up 150% I hope this continues
17389,Are you retarded lol
17390,"No it isn’t. I heard people say this five days ago, three days ago. Yesterday. Tomorrow you will ask the same question."
17391,"Gamestop needs a headline like ""sony to deliver 5 million ps5's before Christmas"" to make to take this shit to rigel 7."
17392,Rolled GME April $13 calls to Feb $22 calls 20 min ago. GME takes a straight line to $22 immediately. Whoa!
17393,This has been answered repeatedly.   It’s $420.69.
17394,Nope shares are going 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
17395,See you on your alt
17396,"I seriously have a fucking problem not buying AMD dips  Like WTF same shit yesterday, barely gained 2% all damn day like shit tons of stuff pumping.."
17397,yes just watch it so you can tell your wife's boyfriend all about it at the christmas party
17398,GME is a pyramid scheme... If you dont realise this guess where you are... the bottom of pyramid
17399,I want a live stream of u/deepfuckingvalue 's account please
17400,SPCE should be in everyone’s stonk portfolio robinhood says it’s a 100% buy rating
17401,the amount of news being reported and shared here is too low
17402,It’s literally too easy to buy the dip. Free money boyssss
17403,MGNI fucking BOOMING. My month’s return looks insane right now haha
17404,"my dad called me a phaggot and said I'm just a stock cheerleader, that I probably let myself get fucked by businessmen, he even said some worse things that I can't say here."
17405,"Your risk is a lot higher now, but if you believe the bull theses (I am not sure whether people are mainly driven by the idea of a short squeeze or Ryan Cohen legitimately turning this into a viable business), then there's still some room to run."
17406,Saw a gme leap that was -2.5% at 19.30.  35c bought for like 2.5.. lmao instantly over 3.5 now
17407,"XPEV will see it's day come, but this overcorrection left a lot of bagholders like myself. If you have shares, just forget about them, this stock has a bright future in 2021. Any good analyst knows they're a top 3 EV stock after TSLA and NIO."
17408,If u don’t buy VXX puts on days like yesterday. WYD??
17409,"FUBO, easily the biggest opportunity on the market right now."
17410,"Not yet, I don't think."
17411,"Another small break for GME to refuel, don’t panic you paper handed bitches"
17412,"Don’t sell it boys, shorts and MMs want to trigger stop losses"
17413,Next time someone pleas kindly punch me in the dick if I bail out of a meme stock like GME again
17414,"Same, Idc if it drops back to $15, I'm riding this one out, it's exciting"
17415,"Congrats, GME Gang. I still think you're all retarded, but what do I know?"
17416,I want to see a fucking gme circuit breaker today
17417,Goldman with the FB buy at 330 pt
17418,DON'T SELL GME IS JUST REFUELING FOR IT'S NEXT FLIGHT
17419,"Buy more, it just slid a bit."
17420,I repeat: i need to buy Santa's outfit asap. So give a quick yolo. Everything flat 🤨
17421,Sold 12/31 tsla 640 for a 40% loss this morning ✅
17422,I dont understand why NIO and TSLA are the same
17423,who is retarded just like me that didn’t buy the NIO dip?
17424,it's 19.9% when I just sold some short at $22
17425,"Thanks. Buying the dip has scorched my ass in the past, just got lucky this time"
17426,GME. You son of a bitch im in
17427,Nobody said you have to buy but you’re a 🤡 for putting down the GME folks
17428,I rolled all my “recovery” plays into icln two weeks ago. My only regret is that I don’t have more money to throw at it.
17429,Santa rally ending this week or is it going to continue till EOY?
17430,god should i just sell my PLTR calls at this point? it’s not looking good
17431,Oh I see didnt know that
17432,GME gang deserve it hats off
17433,"TSLA, you're beautiful."
17434,Next time someone pleas kindly punch me in the dick if I bail out of a meme stock like GME again
17435,well yes i just bought and sold a bunch for %120 gains in less than 30 min  that's pretty retarded
17436,I'd say more like 25
17437,Get GME for a 1% discount rn
17438,Tesla green? Now that surprised me
17439,bought GME puts. Lets see how this goes.....
17440,Why is apple so fucking limp dicked rn
17441,GME gang I can see all of our houses from up here. Future mansions too. 🌎🌙🌠🪐☀️🚀🚀🌌🌌
17442,Looks like Iborrow isn’t updating for gme today? Anyone got any short interest info? Is this straight buying or how much covering we got here?
17443,Sooooo I forgot I’m barred from day trades and I had bought ALOT more $22c FD for GME and I can’t trade them until tmrw and I fucked?
17444,Cool call. If I had any funds left I would have jumped on them as well.
17445,Ride the wave. You are still 1.5 months early.
17446,"I suppose,   But you know rent bailouts are gonna be out soon right?   And with historic low interest rates, wouldn’t you want a downpayment instead?"
17447,couldn't read after i had a flight accident with the GME rocket and i bought Palatin instead of Palantir and it's going to Mars 🚀🚀🚀
17448,someone convince me not to go all in on gamestop at this price
17449,**MGNI**  So hype I got in before close yesterday. This bishhh got a new price target of $50 and will hit $40 by first week of Jan
17450,💎🤚are the 🔑 just remember that
17451,Yea I mean it could’ve always gone the other way - you never know. Just sucks though.. happens more often than not as of recently
17452,at open I had $30k  At 7:47am MT I had $20k  Now I have $33k #tsla
17453,We're the most powerful investment firm in the world. Time to put Melvin capital into liquidation. GME $420.69!
17454,Put for ge for next week ?
17455,I would buy any dip really. Won’t really matter when this is at $40+ soon
17456,I love when my orders don’t fill and I miss out on 400%
17457,Just got out of the RAD contract I opened yesterday for over 20% gain. First options trade I've made since my account got frozen earlier this year while I was homeless and even though I only made $12 it feels good to prove to myself I can trade better than I used to and not hold things until they're worthless waiting for 200% gains every time like a gambling addict
17458,Where are all the Tesla Bubble Bears?
17459,Just saw someone sell a LEAP at the bid price with a bid-ask spread of $300. ouch
17460,"GM, NIO, AAPL  YOU COME AT THE KING YOU BEST NOT MISS"
17461,I'm waiting on money in robinhood to realize so I can transfer to weebull. I couldn't just not trade with all that buying power just sitting there. I didn't want to fomo at the top. So I took a safe bet. TSLA 0DTE calls ATM. Weeeee 🚀🚀🚀
17462,We won't hear from them again. They all went to Valhalla
17463,"JOE up 5 percent, my DD didn’t get a ton of love but you’re welcome to anyone who caught wind 😋"
17464,GME just going on a fuel stop before $25
17465,-1.0% is not a dip
17466,I luv u tsla 😭
17467,Any reason DIS gaps up tomorow?
17468,there's a hole in this Canoo
17469,"BUY THE DIP ON GME! AS STATED, WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED!"
17470,Can you GME fuckers get your own thread? Like congratulations and all but also let’s get some fresh plays in here
17471,My daily chart is straight vertical from 6:45 til now
17472,Buying Tesla weeklies is like giving the keys to the drunkest guy in the car
17473,"Well this was another no Vaseline morning , thanks WSB"
17474,But we work from home. I drive a shitty car too.   Idk maybe I’m the unreasonably frugal one
17475,I was down 80% on GME the other week because I bought at $19... But I held and I'm back in the green now!
17476,"NET already runs the internet, literally can't go tits up"
17477,give a %
17478,Wheres that guy who said he would suck off a homeless person if TSLA went green
17479,Can I get you retards to pump msft and PLTR ?
17480,Sexy dip on square and arkk if you didn’t grab it you lost out
17481,Sorry a bit retarded what does that mean?
17482,"[""This country is doomed, it is doomed! And not just because of African Americans""](https://youtu.be/a3G7n21p0kY?t=4475)  Have fun with your next president"

17484,"for real, this man was LAUGHED at HARD like a year ago, now he's laughing all the way to the bank and telling the haters to jump off a bridge"
17485,This was definitely a short attack
17486,GME 💎👋🏽 rollcall day 2 of squeeze where y’all motherfuckers at?!!!!!! Let’s goo
17487,SALT had a big sell off after a change to its buiness model but its coming back up fast. Lots of upside
17488,"I just want to own it.  I told you GME callers to eat the peanuts out my asshole last week.  Bravo, good sirs.  Please allow me in your gang."
17489,Lmao. It was a Beamer
17490,Yea bro I’m diamond handing these 35c 15 Jan like a true retard LOL
17491,Lol bro I can’t even with GME anymore. I’m actually starting to feel bad for the shorts at this point
17492,"nice I bought the dip 300 shares at 3% down, and 5 x 12/24 160c.   I'm out now with $2k profit"
17493,Thank you!! I was able to walk away with a 10% gain at $158 sell on the dip. If I held again to the $158 rise I’d be down 40% 😂 definitely too close for comfort but I’m glad it worked out
17494,How retarded are shorts? That is the question
17495,"STOP GETTING SCARED OFF BY SHORTERS, THEY ARE ALREADY LOSING MONEY EVERYTIME GME BROKE RESISTANCE"
17496,"Buying 4 opendoor 35 march calls at 3.3 each.  Will be averaging down next couple of days, leaning more towards 6 to a year out, but need to do more dd. This thing looks like it fits my macro, tech and valuation perspective too perfectly."
17497,Your dad sounds like a good man
17498,"Im genuinely happy for GME heads to finally get their wish come true. But cmon, thats not why the market has tanked xD"
17499,I’ve been thinking about him the last couple days I can’t wait to see his update
17500,"that's what I'm thinking, I'm having a hard time deciding if it would just be best to wait to buy anything until tomorrow though"
17501,Haha. Hostile takeover of Melvin capital by a bunch of retards!!!!
17502,HD and CRM killing my portfolio
17503,I’m buying more GME now that it’s slid a tiny bit
17504,Ok guess I’ll make some money shorting it then
17505,GME TOO LOW IMO
17506,Shorts are so far underwater that anyone wanting to short is going to have to wait until the squeeze resolves.
17507,TSLA down 1000 up a stimmy check thank u musk
17508,sometimes boomers are right time in the market beats timing the market.
17509,Ok looks like this week my pltr shares are definitely gonna be called away. Thanks for the memories pltr.
17510,I'll allow it

17770,"I bought my first ever option on FCEL last January. I bought 2 LEAPS for $3 strike with 1/15/21 for $1.10  They didn't budge for 6 months, so I sold and broke even. Now they're going for $9.20.  I hate myself."
17771,I told y’all 50 minutes ago get in
17772,you bought today and want to secure profit?  &amp;#x200B;  turn it into a spread and sell a call 1 strike above. but if i were you id always just play it safe since youre on margin
17773,Think like a boomer! Now we know that in many countries the first group going to get the Vaccine are the old people. This means old people are going to be able to get out and do old people stuff. Now the question is what r they going to do?  I'm placing a bid on RCL. Their biggest customers are after all retired vaccinated Bingo lovers.

17786,Very Low volume too
17787,"im expecting a 10% day in the near future, if not Im big mad"
17788,So are we getting that $600 next week or nah??   Wanna blow my stimulus on Cathie 😍

17793,"You've got a gap you need to close, ARKG."
17794,how much are you up ??
17795,I don't think many people are playing this for the long game (1+ year) until something dramatic happens like Cohen taking over and making big changes
17796,So what’s the deal with GME? Kids spending their 600 stimmy early?
17797,Does anybody here use think or swim? I’m thinking of moving over but I heard you need $5k in it to trade options
17798,i have been pushing for Energy Fuels for the past 3 weeks. Uranium mining and receiving 75 mil in fed funds to establish a solid US reserve is big news guys. please take 5-10 min and research. I really want all of us to get rich.
17799,It’s working for me so far!
17800,Are you sacred ?
17801,Buy American Airlines. They just started bringing employees off furlow which means they are starting to make money again. Many people will be flying for Christmas and that will bring them money. The government is thinking about giving them relief money
17802,I don’t understand what gamestop does that amazon couldn’t also do   Seems like another Barnes and noble... no? Why the run-up

17860,"if you have a stable income, your debt is covered and you have like 3 months of monthly savings on hand then dump everything else into a brokerage fund.  Having money sitting in a savings account has been a waste for years at this point because of interest rates.   What you do in that brokerage account is up to you.  I have 60% ETF's and 40% stocks."

17891,It’s up 70% in a month
17892,pfe will never stop crawling
17893,I imagine in some Short Sellers office - a bunch of them are hovered around a display screen screaming as they read this WSB and see all of the GME buyers.
17894,thats why it was so important to blast past 20. I think a lot of people would have taken profit if it sat there too long. No everyone must believe.
17895,Central. So 1130 eastern
17896,Gamestop the most transparent pump-n-dump that has ever existed

17902,"All right retards, you better believe you should diamond hand these GME shares or get in shares to Vahalla. Why? Because Melvin is gonna swap their shorts position to a long one.

17931,Yes QS drop back down to $70 so I can fomo buy in only for your ass to drop further into $20
17932,ARKG opening at 109 and now at 105 makes me sad
17933,Super low volatility right?
17934,TOS is amazing and no you can start with whatever. Just your options level will be different. I.E can’t sell options just buy... shit like that
17935,because you're zoomed in on 5 minute candles like a fucking moron.
17936,"id wait, it went parabolic and tends to pullback"
17937,Because it’s up 50% already?

17948,Maybe don’t buy at the top?
17949,24 HAS to be the breaking point tho right? That's gotta be the proce where most of them throw their hands up
17950,What if Mango wanted $2000 checks all along and this threat of veto was planned?  Maybe he just wanted to look like he's Santa and that he saved Christmas this pandemic year.
17951,"Market has been open an hour and 8 million GME shares have been traded, that MUST be some shorts covering, right?"

We'll see, could obviously be totally wrong about them  I think another issue for them is lack of supply of PS5/Xbox  This should be resolved in next couple of months, and still think this will remain the number 1 game people will want to buy and play as they upgrade to the newest console.   I'm expecting a 20% upside from current stock price next couple of months."

18093,"**Preamble: Reinfections are common given the opportunity. Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.**  You can estimate antibody half life from how often people are getting reinfected. The antibodies created by the vaccine decay at the same rate.   &gt;Antibody Half Life: The period in which the radioactivity or number of atoms of a radioactive substance decreases by half; similarly applied to any substance, such as a drug in serum, whose quantity decreases exponentially with time.  All other immune responses induced by the vaccine after the initial antibody boost are the same as after a natural infection.  &gt;Next, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html  **1)** If bi-annual vaccine doses are needed, its a problem.

I don't know what to do, i feel like whenever i try to make a play, i just lose a lot of money and once i sell, behold you know, it just get slapped in my face, and whenever i hold, it fucking tanks. ahhhhhh. god help me, maybe i need to play safe and just do ETFs"
18250,Where are all the morons who were here shit talking GME holders after the Q3 ER? THE SAME ER WE ALL KNEW WAS GOING TO BE BAD-MEH TO BEGIN WITH AND HAD ALWAYS SAID WAS INCONSEQUENTIAL TO OUR BULL-THESIS. DUMBFUCKS.

18253,"If GME goes above 30 tomorrow, I will buy a PS5 for one of you degenerates."

18255,GME consolidating here for next leg up???
18256,Fine but I'm still gonna be grumpy about not getting in at $95 a couple days ago.

18262,No other risk. If it hits your strike you sold where you wanted to and you keep the premium
18263,Really?  How does it not to ITM?
18264,I picked up 100 LMND 105p for $500. Will it dump 18% probably not but I stand to make a lot of money if it does lol. I think lock up ends 12/29. So I’ll probably try again that week as well.
18265,"Bought in at 25, sold at 50, and again at 45.  Just bought back in, but yeah...bipolar is a good word for it."
18266,GME needs to get into the EV game so they can have a $70b market cap
18267,chwy fire sale going on right now
18268,PLTR NEW SUPPORT AT $28.90 BETTER GET IN NOW!
18269,Just recieved a letter at work from a lumber supplier saying that they cannot lock in lumber prices for the a huge portion of 2021.  Time to build a wooden rocket 🚀

18274,"I understood a few of those words, Xbox Sux. that's my DD"
18275,Why is zoom down so much today?
18276,Yeah and it's going to keep going
18277,I'd help support a local business but the dinky plastic thing that says over 21 hasnt come in the mail yet. :(
18278,Got it
18279,"Nope. If they have controlled their cash burn, further trimmed the fleet and show strong pent up demand, you might see a slight bump."
18280,Have you guys heard of TSLA? Just found out about it a couple days ago.  Guy who told me said it was an up an coming company with lots of potential
18281,"I just did, and I came to the conclusion that you're a fucking retard."
18282,"Hold, people will re-realize all of the xbox / ps5 have AMD chips"
18283,You guys are horrible influence. I love it 🍺
18284,Did the same with FCEL two days ago. 1/15 10c when it was at 9. Now its at 12.. It's hard to get these paper hands off
18285,if you're autistic then the answer is yes
18286,Don't ask me. I'm one of you guys.
18287,I have sold lot of puts on PLTR CRSR NIO AMD PSTH. wont mind assignment on those.
18288,stop being a pussy
18289,"there are 10 amazing trades you miss every second, don’t get hung up on it and go find the next good trade"
18290,They’re really trying to normalize the stock market bubble by pointing to low interest rates   *This is the real paradigm shift*
18291,Do you never win? Are you tired of losing money?    Look at AMD!  SIX red days in a row. Wow thats scary 🥵. Maybe that means its going down to 0😳  No. Btfd. Or chase GME your choice
18292,Hop in on MVIS dip before it’s gone ya’ll
18293,"Yup, paid the entirety of the loan with the gains, and for most of the inventory. Could have paid for all of it with Tesla gains, but I didn’t want to sell all my Tesla stock haha."
18294,Ahh so just riding the wave to its death I see
18295,I think we already have a winner in AAPL vs TSLA
18296,It might finally be time for BABA. Been waiting awhile.
18297,"Babby's first options!  I had already bought 100 GME at about 15$ a couple weeks back.  I sold a covered call against them, 12/31/2020 18.00 C.  (Did I write that right?)  Needless to say they are ITM now, about a week out from expiration.  So, worst case, I get assigned at 18, make a couple hundred plus the premium.  Not a loss, but I'd like to see how much further this could go.    Should I just assume it will get assigned on 12/31 if it's still ITM?  How likely is it that it could get assigned sooner than that?  Who makes that decision?  I assume the market maker, rather than some other random retail investor?"
18298,I think they had a chance to get in s&amp;p not sure tho
18299,Thank the Christmas spirits for blessing us with a green day in these bearful times
18300,Stock market is open tomorrow. It's xmas?
18301,that explains a spike...I am also in on the first of that list even though a price of 10 per share is based on the valuation of an optimistic 2025 revenue of 1.something billion. So betting that mad optimism* drives it beyond any sense.   *we know what it really is
18302,Now where's that dude who is proud of being a gme 🌈🐻?

18306,Prepping for a short squeeze
18307,Net is fisting me hard but it’s not enjoyable
18308,ARKG more growth potential. Soon they are going to be able to engineer bitches with three titties and you'll regret not being all in.
18309,PSA: wait for the next decent aapl pull back and buy non retarded calls 3-6 months out. Free money.
18310,AND IF ANY OF YOU SELL AT $40 YOU'RE A BITCH ANYWAY
18311,"Buy it for your hospital, anyone that held GME after earnings can afford it and anybody that didn't doesn't deserve it. Hell I only had 100 stocks and I can buy one from the gains so far."
18312,Kos itm calls looking pretty tasty right now
18313,I want whatever you’ve been smoking! But nah tsla has been traded in GME and PLTR. 🤣
18314,I’d feel happy for you guys. But if I buy in and it hits 18 instead I’d be pissed for the rest of the holidays

18322,God damnit AAPL is such a piece of shit
18323,Doesn’t matter
18324,LOL there are only 2000 bids at 28.90. THat is nothing. Do you even look at the level 2 book?
18325,Are you sure? I don’t want to sell and get locked out for 90 days :(
18326,"I want one, too. Pinky promise that you'll get us one if it reaches $30?"
18327,"Once PLTR gets over the 29 hump, it’s off to the races"
18328,Elon is the captain now
18329,I mean it tried to sell off and was immediately bought up

18337,Why is AMD so limp dicked. Anyone buying more here?
18338,guys the chwy dip is a fire sale BUY BUY BUY
18339,5G isn't though. 5G F.A.N will replace traditional ISPs down the line.   It did spend a tremendous amount of money recently and will continue to but most definitely will be aided by government in next infrastructure bill. I'm a buyer here. Hell I'm buying the 75s too   TMUS has more price upside potential but also more risk. AT&amp;T is a boomer stock.
18340,sold calls and bought put for BAC next week. rsi seems too high . should pull back before aiming higher. also might have sell off later on day and tomorrow because of holiday. what u guys think ?
18341,The trick is to cash out on those kinds of quick gains instead of holding like traditional stocks and losing it all like most of the Diamond hands retards on here
18342,"I bought at the top before ER and held till now, not selling until at least 50"
18343,taking these meme gotten gainz and buying that AMD dip. is this sound?

18356,short squeeze bro duh!!!  I shorted a bunch of shares after we bounced off $22
18357,If you’re not buying up as much AMD as possible at this price you’re insane
18358,PLTR is the worst.... wait no...... I love you PLTR......wait...... fuck off PLTR......... hold up...... “get in on PLTR now!!!”
18359,"market is dumb as hell, and so is wsb 🤷‍♂️"
18360,Wtf is AAPL doing today
18361,Pretty bullish if they end up releasing the holiday update today like there’s rumors about. Supposed to redo the interface in the cars and boost range on model 3s. If they can push the update while they’re beta testing FSD in the wild and updating that constantly that’s pretty good imo.
18362,Sad to see you on sidelines.  It's boomer once Cramer shills it  Making crazy profit ATM
18363,"GME IS STUCK AT 22, BUY BEFORE IT ROCKETS AGAIN"
18364,"if you’re selling PLTR I have one question for you,  do you like having your wife’s boyfriend fuck her in your home more or do you prefer taking her to his house?"
18365,"bulls: don't forget GME actually represents Gamestop, the shitty store that sells shitty plastic dolls that you haven't been to in 10 years  Be careful :)"
18366,Never in all my years on WSB have I seen anyone deserve their gains more than u/deepfuckingvalue. He most be sitting on about $5 mil this morning from his $100k investment.
18367,I mean... not trying to be a dick here... but people probably said the same thing yesterday when they bought puts at close. You don't know what the market is going to do man.

18369,"Apple drilling and it's about to take the entire Nasdaq down with it, with no survivors."
18370,Sometimes you gotta take a break and reassess your investment style and decide if you want large fast gains with high risk or small slow gains with low risk. This shit can be a casino if you’re not keeping a clear head. I took 4 months off trading this year and came back and made 3k in a day and then lost 10k in a week and this shit takes no prisoners if you not on your toes
18371,Easily 700 by Christmas Eve. Youll see most movement between 3pm - AH

18374,Do you know what sub you're on?
18375,"because you're up against a potential short squeeze. Heavy short interest in the stock and the shorts will eventually need to close, further driving the price up"
18376,Any and all

18383,I'm just drunk and long $T  I love this sub all the same.
18384,Put it all in PLTR. This is the way!!!
18385,"I'm doubtful longterm for GME. But in the medium term they won't go bankrupt, that's what shorts bet on. If they can reduce the B&amp;M location to a sustainable amount, expand their inventory to PC Hardware, Desks, Chairs, other  (digital) Merch aswelk as ESport collaboration than just Chapo Pops and offer a good omnichannel experience (ecommerce, pickup, using their stores as storage for same day delivery etc.), I'm sure they will find a niche as a specialty store in this growing market.  Think about it, we are entering a decade in which for the first time ever, three generations are consuming video games. They just need to capitalize on this."
18386,"In case it’s not obvious, anytime you see red. Buy."
18387,it won’t work for a company like GME

18489,"In terms of the stock market, what do you think was the defining month of the market for this year? I know most people would say March because it was the most memorable(-20% in a month, VIX spiking to 80)... but honestly for me... I'm gonna say April.  This year was defining, more than covid even, by the concept of ""stonks only go up"" and ""brrr printing"". No month of the year defined that more than April.  "" **April** was the **stock** market's **best** month in over 30 years with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 12.7%, the Dow 11.1% and the Nasdaq 15.5%. ""  During April, we still had the massive random down days, particularly early in the month. But it was more than countered by massive green up spike days. There were days in April where there would be ""promising news on vaccine"", even just rumors of it, and SPY would go up 2-3% in one day."

Then for the next month traded sideways high 9K low 10K   -11K; Aug 8th touched 11K and the following 3 days went down (over 3%)   -12K; Sep 2nd; touched 12K following 3 days down over 12% didn’t touch 12K again until Nov. 24th   Don’t be a tard and cash some of your profits. You can get back in at a much better price."

Seems to be holding steady. Maybe the ones that were going to cash out for the year have had their fill.  Got 31 contracts for 30 at Feb 19. I plan on selling during the ride up before the financials call on Feb 11."

18800,"Right. That's exactly why the short squeeze will NOT happen, and why this is going to run right back down. Although probably to a higher low.

18879,Nah we won’t get any stimulus now lol
18880,"Stocks, it's not even close."
18881,"Same here. I made most of my portfolio from their weeklies. Unfortunately, the most money I ever had in them (weeklies), was a couple weeks ago and the 8% plummet wrecked me. I had bought itm weeklies because they're much safer and you can get out with most, except when that happens. Lost 3k that Friday and another 6k in premiums but im sure they'll return.   I made the rough decision to sell most of my jan calls for March ones this week. Couldn't chance. Selling for 150% when I was up 800% 2 weeks prior was a bad feel, much worse than eating 40% losses.  I liquidated a lot of my portfolio buying leaps last week. So im really 80% all in qc0m. I got faith.   Exercising some calls early next year too once they're $10+ ITM."

18947,I exited at 41ish. Made a good chunk but it just doesn't seem to have the strength it did before
18948,The most confusing thing to me is why doesn't everybody put 100% of their portfolio into PLTR?
18949,There’s probably going to be a lot of profit taking at the end of the year. You could roll them out to Jan 35s or later

18991,Ebay?   Craigslist?
18992,What? What are you saying GME? YOU WANT TO FLY AGAIN??!
18993,"How I actually make money buying and selling calls:  - Buy calls when stocks dip 5-10% in a day, never buy a stock that was up 5-10% in a day unless incredibly bullish news comes out (I.e. when Tesla was announced to be added to S&amp;P) - either sell your calls right at open or don’t look at your stocks for the first 15 minutes before selling. Don’t flip flop or you’ll end up paper handing literally everything. Make up your mind and stay consistent. - buy calls towards the EOD unless you’re confident a stock will rise all day, which rarely happens. (This is more for people who don’t have $25k and cannot day trade all day) - don’t get caught bagging on IV crushing days."

And I've heard of TDA doing that if you call them and ask.  One thing to keep in mind. Your first deposit will take 2 or 3 days to clear.  You can buy shares immediately, but no options until that clears. So, keep that in mind. You might transfer half out of RH  now, then the other half once it clears.  Any deposits after that hit overnignt"
19002,"yeah i'm gonna take a break. I bought C L N E today and lost 3k already. I really thought it was going to rip because i saw an order of 172,000 on it, but it only went up a little and once the market opened it just tanked.

19072,I used to play the same way until it fucked me up in September 1st week.  I lost like 200k and market was just stuck and I had had over 100 contracts of Apple long term. That fucked me up real bad. That’s why weeklies are here to save my boat and take me from 100 to 330 like it was before.

19086,Sorry for the late response. $18 and $19 are the most feasible and they have good volume on them. $20 has the highest volume because it’s a round number but I think that it’s a bit more far-fetched. $25 strikes are also only $20 if you’re feeling bold.

I’ve been holding G I K and N G A and they both hadn’t been doing much but after seeing GOEV hit 25 yesterday I’m hoping they do something similar when they merge.

19444,y’all really sleeping on PRPL... it’s just such a fucking winner

19450,If it gets to its high of .91 it will be a good day.
19451,When are we selling GME???
19452,Such a dependable ETF. Got 600% returns on 24c 12/18 I grabbed in november
19453,They did the same shit with RIOT. People missed out on a shit ton of money
19454,"Yeah I didn’t want folks to get discouraged when I noticed how flat they’ve been in my portfolio. For transparency, about 30 percent of my portfolio is split between June 35c (5 percent in June 40c), but my average cost is around 90 on the 35c from purchasing last week. The fact is, we are getting closer and closer to the money with these contracts despite them trading flat these past couple days, so the options are gaining more intrinsic value. As QQQJ gets more attention over the following months I easily see these options acquiring more extrinsic value (volatility) as volume increases."

19475,"Calls or shares? You’re probably good with shares (though I’m expecting there will be another pullback). If you bought weekly calls, RIP your money."
19476,Sometimes you just have to liquidate take the day off and come back the next with a clearer mind. Do some digging on potential stocks during the down time and maybe set yourself up with a few long calls for companies you see doing well in 2021.
19477,Anyone know why FireEye is rocketing? It seems like all security/software stocks are climbing because of palantire and snowflake
19478,news that aapl is making it's own chips now

19480,What do you see going down with $T?
19481,Being on the west coast must be rough to catch the market open. 6 30 am sheesh. Far easier on the east coast where i can wake up at 9 make a cup of coffee and watch the open.
19482,What are the chances Amazon splits?
19483,"When you divorce, it’s usually 50/50. She didn’t do jack shit"
19484,XL fleet. Up 44% right now. Buy in if there’s an afternoon dip
19485,Hope you guys bought that WKHS dip today. Down 7% at one point now about to go positive
19486,Today would be the day if it was going down
19487,That's how you know it's a good investment
19488,You are a moron. Google what a pyramid scheme is.
19489,Facts the mortgage depends on it too

19491,"That's how it always be like. Rockets and establishes a new resistance and support, fades until everyone forgets about it, and repeat."
19492,I want to buy BNTX but it seems to always go down regardless of news
19493,PLTR Numba 1 BAC Numba 1
19494,I wish this wasn't so true
19495,Rip tsla s&amp;p won't let it run wild anymore
19496,I’ll fuck you ass 2 ass with it while I sell off
19497,"Yeah had I played things better I could have made money but my dumb ass threw money at the NET dip and watched it get eaten, so I’m trading flat lol"
19498,Exit now
19499,Hey. At least that will probably get to you at some point. At least some of it anyway.
19500,What if she was the smart one and he just did the hard work?  That bold fuck doesn't look smart at all
19501,"Dead stimulus means optimism for future successful stimulus though... should be a lot of Pelosi phone calls and emails about this new, bigger package"
19502,"I did yesterday, JAN $95 calls but the stock is up 1% and theta ate it up overnight...  Wait for it to dip some more, it is doing fucking nothing right now, completely flat..."
19503,congrats   you made it
19504,"I know they say don’t fuck with the mouse but they are a damn monster.  Bought my 1 year old daughter shares at $109, the poor girl is going to have to pay taxes"

19506,you're only as good as your last trading day.
19507,whats everyone thinking about dis now
19508,Buy under 50 sell over 50. No catalyst to ever make it go over 55 :(.
19509,That’s what you’re thinking about right now??
19510,0%. It’ll end up being 10k/share.
19511,If u have to ask ur retarded and time to sell is now
19512,"Thank us in a month, diamond hands baby"
19513,DKNG FD's are free money...
19514,"they were down significantly for the week, based on some turd's downgrade. I bought the dip. That's it."
19515,No GME isn’t done. Not even close. Take any dips you can (shares only) cuz it’s on the way to $35-40.
19516,Well I won't consider myself fucked because it's my smallest position. Was more of a quick gamble with an amount a won't mourn. But I agree I'll probably stay away from any near expiry calls on them from here in out.
19517,People ask me to handle their investments but when I tell them they should have 40k minimum because of the PDT rule they get a little concerned (they want to dip their toes in options with me making the decisions).  You don't want to be riding anywhere near the 25k line if you are actively trading.
19518,"Sold, I betting it’ll dip to 16 or less before DA"
19519,Anyone else just a week fucking early on their options? My shit expires worthless and then the next week it shoots. I’m not just talking about FDs either.
19520,But she wasn’t. So let’s stop thinking of false statements. “WHAT IF...” stfu lol
19521,FEYE. Crazy low market cap compared to Cloudflare and Crowd. Yet way higher revenue. They are one of top 3 cyber security companies and about to explode in 2021
19522,$TSLA 1275/1300 Jan 2022 Debit Spread tenderoni or nah?? They’re only $200
19523,I would've loved this a week ago :(
19524,AAPL and PLTR most manipulated stocks ever
19525,that was smart. i tried timing it yesterday and missed out on some gains on my $16c's that printed. figured i'd let it ride this time.
19526,"What timeline though?  June options?  Pricing looks decent, IV is low, but will travel be back enough by June?  50 C?"
19527,"O,C,G,N going to %1000"
19528,Looks like a boring theta day
19529,Instead of $2000 should send everybody OTM calls! It’ll be the best free money you can have!
19530,"Yeah, I play with what I can lose. It would suck to lose but not devastating."
19531,You think it's going to be more of a shit show than November huh?
19532,Are you saying the rug pull is coming
19533,I know right?  What are we selling today boys?
19534,Non of the shorts covered yet lol. There’s still a huge amount of outstanding short interest
19535,XOM pays an 8% dividend...if you own shares and this thing goes up for a year that's going to be a big multiplier.  It's not FD banger money but in the good scenario just sitting on shares could net you a lot of dough!
19536,Just YOLO'd in PLTR ........ ROCKETSHIP
19537,Volume hasn't picked up enough for the squeeze. This is literally paper hands and more shorting happening.
19538,feye going to up another 10% tomorrow I can feel it in my palms
19539,"depends on expiration, like FDs expiring tomorrow sell or roll it to a further date  monthlies hold"
19540,What are you guys thinking about ZM? can it go further down?
19541,And there's a six figure year gents
19542,Not to sound like a bear that is gay... but is anyone else suspicious of this rally? Shouldn’t we anticipate little a pull back?
19543,"GME day chart bullflag or dead cat bounce, EOD gonna be  wild"

19556,"Saw this in Instagram search and explore lol, the guy has a solid point https://imgur.com/vJgGPil"
19557,The news of joining S&amp;P is what let it run wild tho
19558,I'm not saying I'm a God. I'm actually drunk and you should ignore me. HOWEVER!  Why is the stock this high at all?
19559,GME keeps going up and I can't stop fapping
19560,It looks like PLTR will keep resisting at 29.20😔
19561,Dme going to cuck you all today!
19562,Upvote if you’re a business man doing business.
19563,I take it you're at the bottom of the pyramid? I've done extensive research on this and admitidly my explanation was brief and doesn't cover the entire explanation
19564,Bought the GME dip 1000 more shares and a few calls let’s go my fellow GameStop retards
19565,Can we please just go one leg higher so I can cash out and then go bear again
19566,Idk about NET but CRSR is a bipolar bitch so tread carefully with her.

19570,# but he raped all those basic bitches.
19571,Is covid over now
19572,they are waiting for a christmas miracle thats likely not gonna happen
19573,The real reason you should only play the most wacky volatile stocks is it's too fucking expensive for firms to pin the fucking price so all options lose
19574,It’s ok we will push past just give it a couple days
19575,"I am mostly holding what one might call super-leads, stonks if you will, so not much of the tingles here."
19576,"I definitely have covid, no positive test but you'd think getting tested would be easier and widely available rn... Fuck this country wish I could cough on Congress"
19577,at 8:50 AM Oracle is going to shoot up a dollar
19578,Shh that stock is forbidden here! It makes too much money.
19579,How can I buy VIX shares? It is super low compared to earlier this year
19580,":( i think earnings are coming up late january, possibly good if yall have em out that far"
19581,"Hold, it’s gotta dip at some point right lol"
19582,I think the next earnings will look better than expected because of holidays. I'd honestly look at March around $45 to $50. Delta will probably have another 10 - 15 percent day or something in between then and now.
19583,Lmfao fucking bunch of retards living in their parents basements are eons ahead of these boomer brokers
19584,"Nasdaq down but DOW and SandP up.  What's propping up the market?  Financials, cyclicals, leisure, and industrials?"
19585,"Two bull theories on GME pumping:  1. Its the squeeze (read a dd, there's...a few) or 2. Cohen's increased position is a signal of a business model shift and its valuation is changing accordingly to more bullish estimates.   Either way, get in and don't sell 🚀🚀🚀"
19586,I have a dead USO option that is staring me in the face on RH  How tf do I hide it? Or delete it?

19590,NET for a steady ride up
19591,I’m shorting lots of Female CEO’s companies. No way can a Woman run em well
19592,"It's possible, we need higher volume however. There weren't any big players this morning, and volume is largely neutral on the day with a veeery slight skew towards bearish, but that can be attributed to hedging more than anything. Best guess is that they're sitting out until concrete news drops."
19593,How do you know it’s covid?
19594,Heard aapl is going to build a car again....
19595,"Maybe hold another week then sell, you’ve already lost your ass. GME has dumped after each big run up before running up more but who knows if this time is the real squeeze or not"
19596,Shit should have gotten out of FB while I could

19608,Damn... what a cornball
19609,You’re puts are toast man this thing is getting forced up
19610,"Usually if a certain ticker is annoying you, if you look at the posts themselves you’ll find that 90% of them are actually coming from the same shitty person. And you can simply block that person :). I do it all the time and it makes things so much better."
19611,My lotto play for the day is CLDR 1/15 calls. A whale bought in so I feel safe  🤑🤑🤑
19612,Accept defeat homie. This was a bad play and will continue to be a bad play until console sales numbers come out or ER.
19613,Honestly though. This thing has not moved like this before. I was on a hot streak with all calls and pull this fucking PUT play.
19614,thought about it and figured MT shares taking too much capital so dumped all 600 shares for small gain and went with April calls and June debit spread instead.. did 25c/35c. cheaper this way for 10x vs the 600 shares i was randomly buying to join WSB MT gang  ties up way less capital and gets me my random WSB gang fix
19615,They were schilling it hard here yesterday. Funny how that works
19616,"was up 30% at some point from buying dips, held on too long ofc, now flat. smh"

19620,Both of those things are extremely bullish. Those aren’t necessarily Mutually exclusive 💰
19621,Universe I ask for my calls to go up as a Christmas gift  Thank you
19622,I think it will eventually lead to a much bigger stimulus in 30-60 days. How can markets stay afloat with no omnibus/Covid relief happening until then?
19623,MT with nice green for some good momentum heading into 2021. One week chart is turning upwards and 3 month looks awesome. Slow and steady here! VALE on the other hand has been like watching an animal slowly die for the last week. Hoping for a nice bounce there soon. No reason for it to stay down
19624,PORTFOLIO IS SOARING AFTER SHORTING WOMAN CEO’s. EZ RETURNS. You can’t expect one to run a company 😂
19625,Looks like we already found it
19626,itll be end of day. I bet he keeps his nose out of it during the day to keep emotion out.
19627,"Cramer: Selling EV Stocks. We're all thinking it. But not me, and you shouldn't either. Buy everyone in your family 100x of each of these stocks for Christmas or you're a shitty person. I should know, I'm a cheap ass. But seriously all EV stocks to the moon. Fuck the bears."
19628,I’m trying to learn how to hedge. But it seems like I’m just wasting money on the gains I made.

19631,"Not on subs where people actually make money. I think you're looking for r/investing , r/stocks , r/personalfinance and r/bitchboy ."
19632,Thats one of the reason why I stopped using RH lol being haunted by my mistakes like that front and center everytime i open it up
19633,Anyone think GME is about to pull a Domino’s and become a tech company that sells gaming stuff or are we all playing the squeeze?
19634,"same, just let it die peacfully"
19635,ouch but if they were winners then a profit is a profit  try again with some $26 1DTE?

19641,fuck bro i made 2k swinging calls when it was moving between the 645-647. was down 1k when it dipped and just held it out. if you rlly believe it’ll go back up then take losses and re enter at a lower price.

19652,This aged well
19653,"It does but that’s not the point. The point is to cover losses from your main positions when it takes a massive dive. Then sell your hedge profits and average down on your position that lost  I lose about 2k a week in put hedges but make more, I’d you make less cause your hedges it’s a bad hedge"
19654,"Cathy would like a word with you, with Sue Bae."
19655,"Yeah November went smoother than most people expected.  No civil disturbance, etc.  Might have to pay the piper for it in next month.  Just don't trust mango to do what's right for anyone but him and his family and even then in vengeance might not give AF."
19656,"So if Republicans kill the stimulus, they pretty much cuck themselves in Georgia... I wonder if that’s why weed stonks are rallying today"
19657,"I loaded up on calls right after that drop. If my analysis is correct, it'll drop another 20%. Seems to be the pattern when I buy in."
19658,"Had a headache past few days, back aches, stuffy nose nothing crazy but I've lost my smell and taste in less than 48 hours plus someone in my house had a positive test. I got tested last in October and was negative."

19665,There are easier places to make money than shorting a bubble stock right as the bubble is taking off. I’d sell the $2k and buy $2k of apple calls expiring right after the ER in late Jan. You’ll probably make back your loss. The ER will be historic. Why play the game on hard mode.
19666,Yeah at the time I would’ve thought that was a smart play too but yet it’s going up still :/
19667,"Really glad NIO, and PLTR chatter has died down, to be replaced with GME again. /s For what it's worth, congrats GME."

19692,"MM's are not selling TSLA, bullish right now"
19693,I was confused about it too so I had to get clarity through some dd but overall its a shit company but not shitty enough at this lvl and it’s shorted to the oblivion that it’s costing lot of money/interest for bears to short to keep the price down so it’s only a matter of time for them to cover with price going up because it’s costing to much money to keep it down

19720,What a whore!
19721,Hedges work like strangles. Should be small &amp; many. I use them to finance riskier plays. Mostly selling premium on OTM puts n calls. Similar to playing a slot machine while sitting at a poker table.
19722,"If NIO doesn't pop heading into and coming out of NIO Day, I'm probably done betting on Chinese car companies I know nothing about."
19723,Funny because I made the money from 10 contracts of Apple calls yesterday. I made 5k yesterday. I have 7 Apple 133C 12/31 now as well that are bleeding.
19724,Just hold and lose everything. You deserve it for betting against us
19725,lets see what you got GME gang
19726,who is throwing snakes on all these posts
19727,GME shorts:  https://i.redd.it/h3cemiyn9rd31.jpg
19728,everyone selling PLTR today will have a story to tell next year about how they sold PLTR at 28 before it rocketed to 100
19729,"Looking a year or two out, pretty safe to assume AMZN and AAPL beat the SPY annually, yes?"
19730,Dude what the fuck is aapl problem? Seriously
19731,The 2 fucking pullbacks (3% mind you) got v bounced by bullshit news and stupid expectations of a 2k stim check
19732,"6 careful, methodical, decisive trades with 1K exposure and $325 profit. I call it a day.  TlDr: got lucky day trading TSLA FD lotto."
19733,"I have a position of 100 shares. I sell 5 every 50 cents the price goes up. I have 65 left. Doing the math, I’ll be out of shares when it hits $25. That’s my PT."
19734,"This place is so soft now..... Too popularized, way too many LEFTISTS/SOCIALISTS in here. Smells like bitch."
19735,what are the chances GME hits 26 by EOD
19736,All I wanted was a pepsi and she wouldn't give it to me.
19737,Lidar &amp; hydrogen FTW today boys
19738,ITS ALL YOUR FAULT
19739,"Because calls will require to to try and time the price movement. Also, if you pay a high premium and then the price dumps and you sell, you have probably just donated to the shorts cash reserves allowing them to continue to not cover. If the price goes up and you sell your calls, a short can purchase and decrease costs of covering. Most importantly, the only way to force the squeeze is to decrease the amount of shares in float. Shorts will not cover until staring down the barrel of a market with very few shares to buy. The goal is to create a shortage of shares supply so that people betting on downward price movement stand to lose more by continuing to hold that position than just buy shares."
19740,Hold or sell SQ 235c 12/31 for a small loss?
19741,fuck it buy more pltr on the dip
19742,Yesterday GME made another nice run in the afternoon so there may be some more fomo action still today.
19743,Ye but all three could decline
19744,"Stop lowes, you're killing me"
19745," Imagine paper handing GME just now, fucking clowns 🤡"
19746,someone pls ELI5&amp;R what a reverse split does to my calls
19747,"ARKG is truly incredible, I wonder where this thing will realistically be in a year?"
19748,"banned for two weeks, i'm back fellas.   all i can say is CATHIE IS BAE"
19749,&gt; either sell your calls right at open or don’t look at your stocks for the first 15 minutes before selling. Don’t flip flop or you’ll end up paper handing literally everything. Make up your mind and stay consistent.  All you have to do is recognize gaps and plan accordingly. There's more money to be made there.
19750,"debit spreads for GME 22/23 for next week are dirt cheap and a fucking no brainer. easy 3/4 bagger for even the poorest of us broke boys (looking at you, bears looking for redemption)"
19751,There's a bot for that.
19752,LGVW 🦋 is soaring for the second day in a row. Hop on before it’s too late 🚀 🚀 🚀

19754,High likely is it AAPL recovers. 12/24 calls ending tomorrow fuck
19755,$FOUR might be a good buy right now. Testing resistance onto its price channel
19756,"Yeah, I deliberately chose a post-earnings expiry. Got the same for CRSR and NIO. Expecting all to beat earnings but who knows."
19757,ouch  The 1DTE 25s sold for a low of 7 cents this morning and a hight of 1.25 so far
19758,"Thx E*TRADE sucks, you’d think they’d put that in the News section of the security you’re in"
19759,It seems like Elon wrote this tweet to show Timmy's visionary on electric cars
19760,I bought FEYE at 16.20. It's been a good run but I'm taking profits for now.  May get back in at some point.
19761,FUCK it GME here I cume

19763,SQ give spit shine finishes every damn day and you’re gunna rag on it the one red MORNING?!? MY GOODNESS
19764,"I swear, bears are not even real. More like theta gang imposters trying to sell weeklies because they come and disappear so fast every single damn week lol"
19765,Yea 2021 will be a big year I'm not selling for a while
19766,When 20 posts start talking about GME being dead because it goes from +11% to +6% it makes me wonder.
19767,I typically am always with y’all. Owell!
19768,“Before it’s too late” 🤣
19769,"The usual DD shit: ""Considering other EV related spacs has a price target of $60 per share and TSLA going to mars then a conservative estimated target for the greatest battery maker in the world (according to some guy living in his moms basement) would be about $230.""  Fuck it. I'm holding..."
19770,2.2k% return on a meme option i bought for $50......fuck me

19772,"MSFT,AMZN, ADBE"
19773,GMEs graph looks like a hunched over WSB autist giving the finger to all of the people still shorting it.
19774,"Righttttt...if you were choosing between AMZN and AAPL, which would you bet on for the next 5?"
19775,It's amazing how often NIO just plunges after opening every day only to rebound. It's honestly like every day i look at the stock its the same chart with a gigantic dip in the first 30 minutes.
19776,PLTR PLEAS FLY AGAIN  &amp;#x200B;  RIOT PLEAS FLY AGAIN  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  RDFN PLEAS FLY AGAIN
19777,"I suspect Republicans are trying to figure out a position  so that they can shift blame to democrats for this not happening, but Pelosi played this well by offering unanimous consent and immediate passage of 2,000 payout with no other changes. Trump wants changes to the bill, most important of which is section 230 revoked, which will never happen. Maybe it’s McConnell that has to speak up before people realize this thing is dead? 🤷‍♂️"
19778,What you mean? All my tech hella green
19779,AMZN and AAPL are the SPY
19780,"Pelosi owns 1.3 Mil in CRWD. FEYE has a lot of room to grow. MSFT is coordinating all efforts w the military, has a special ops division, and has been  hiring top talent, phd’s and military-trained cyber pros."
19781,Calls on UPS. Motherfuckers are towing around U-Haul trailers behind their trucks to carry extra packages
19782,"Its a turtle stock, literally only moves 5% on huge massive big pp day."
19783,Anyone watching NK? Contracts have been on a 🎢 🎢 today
19784,"It will be just like with when it declared profits over the summer, the hype isn’t there now people are just collecting profits.   If there’s something else that can hype it up again it can go to the moon once more, but it’s based on hype not value so I don’t know what else there could be to get people excited"

19790,it hurts
19791,"GME gang, I'm proud of you guys.   You stuck with it.  Got fuckin kicked by the betas on every dip.  You're the captain now."

19799,I can’t tell you what the price will do today or tomorrow. I can tell you that it will have a monster ER and the stock will rocket afterwards. I’d roll those Dec 24 into Jan 29 or early Feb.
19800,"3. A bunch of losers on the internet psyched each other out to buy this autistic stock, price will fall once their FDs expire/they lose interest."

19814,Pretty legitimate I think. The buys are coming in waves and there was a buy wave around mid afternoon yesterday. The shorts have weak hands and tax loss selling. WSB is in control.
19815,Since I’m poor I can only afford a couple baba calls but we in boys! $260c 1/15/21

19842,Its gonna be hard as fuck to sell at any point. The artists here have been throwing numbers like 1000 around which I know is impossible but how can I sell at 50 or 100 when these retards are talking about 1000?
19843,Sir this is not a 1930s wendys

19845,We are trying to make $$$ you autist
19846,So you see this market is refusing to even drop a single bit or break out despite all that bullshit vertical movements from the lows
19847,agree. waiting to see if theres another small dip to get more
19848,Nothing. Value remains the same as what it was worth prior to the split. So just take your strike price and apply the same ratio as the share price and that's your new strike price. Greeks not taken into account.
19849,Hire a PR firm to shill on wsb and seekingalpha?
19850,Totally get it. That's fine. I didn't go all in it either. Most of it is from my aapl gains from yesterday

19910,"If you want to play GME, buy fucking shares you idiots. Stop buying options. You will most likely lose you premium and even if it works out, when you sell you are only providing cover for shorts. If you buy calls, only buy them to exercise and remove more shares from the market. This shouldn’t be a difficult concept. It’s basic supply and demand. Less shares in the market, the higher the price. The higher the price the more financial incentive shorts have to cover this further driving up the price. Ride that gravy train up until you see a green candle $5 tall in the 1min charts."

20008,LISTEN UP RETARDS   If you haven’t been watching FUBO. It’s a ridiculous stock. These guys are going to own exclusive sports broadcasting rights soon. They also dabble in letting people gamble. They are now making more per customer than the annual subscription rate. 90+% approval on Glassdoor. 100% approval of the CEO. This is a HUGE 2021 stock. It dipped today because it had two massive days and people want profits. Take advantage of this opportunity. You will never see it at $55 again.
20009,I’d say 50/50

20052,GME going up with that small of a volume is making my cock rock hard

20054,Rolled my aapl profits into fb yesterday thank god
20055,WSB memes commence GME PLTR FEYE FLY BBY FLY
20056,Yeah.  I have a wire coming in and want to buy puts a few weeks out for like 20 or even like 23 ITM but who knows.  I just don't understand it.  I mean is it solely because of the short squeeze that's supposed to come and not based at all in what the fuck they actually do as a company.
20057,Just screen shot my gains to my friend. Hope the market doesn’t tank like it always does after screenshotting

20069,I would venture an opinion that it would only go up with spring/summer and the increase in solars presence no?
20070,"Thanks, I didn't know that. I just bought it on a gut impulse."
20071,Reminds me of all the people who bought AMD in the single digits just to sell it at 30. Let it ride baby!
20072,"Damnn you have fucking iron balls. No hedge either. That's an awesome return, congrats. Im assuming you sold all that. Why didn't you buy any spring calls on the dip? You can afford the good atm ones too.   Yeah, September fucked me heavily. Played atv! the worst way possible, which I learned a lot from, and that week sold 3 of my jan of my 5 qc0m 150 jan calls (1.45 avg) for less than 2 though they were worth twice that earlier in the week (and $14 dec 9). Vowed to never get scared like that again.  My account is homeless compared to yours. I only had 25 qcom calls to start the day and now have 15, only 3 left for 2020. Just happy to recover a lot but not all of my losses on weeklies from past 2 weeks this morning.   Good shit man. I dont sell the dumper holding price down so hoping out of the rut and can glide to 160 into 2021.   Skyw0rks also has crazy swings but I don't trust non weeklies on it."
20073,Probably forever because people are retards

20085,GOD DAMMIT AAPL JUST GO GREEN LIKE YOU WERE PREMARKET
20086,i dumped a bunch on APHA shares - not options - after they acquired Sweetwater. I think that Biden legalizes federally and that is their in to the American market. THC drinks are huge right now in my anecdotal experience of living in a legal state.
20087,That’s a well thought out answer. It’s funny 🥭 did this. Shits on the Republican Party who is adamantly against this and it shows the people what they could have gotten but almost certainly won’t get. Truly an autisticly genius move.
20088,"What the fuck, augmented reality is when you mix virtual reality with what's actually there. Why would you add virtual objects in a movie theatre? Also, AMC would need studios to do it since they dont make the content themselves, meaning it will also work for streaming services and people can experience this at home."
20089,GME cannot be fucking stopped lmao this is so retarded
20090,"AAPL, planning on doing anything today?"
20091,It’s worrying until you start seeing a profit.
20092,F

20114,It’s lame now but it should be testing ATH soon
20115,"My account is back from the dead literally retarded. Up 1.2K (715)% today. It’s so fucking stupid. When I mean back from the dead, I mean like fucking dead dead.  Anyway, what’s the next play for me to make my 70k back?"
20116,All the more reason to buy in
20117,mods are bears
20118,"Hey GME bulls...  Don't look at the massive put orders coming in for GME right now, you might panic sell"
20119,Activision bro on CNBC with a DIABLO IV shirt on. FUCKING HYPEEEE
20120,That’s why I’m saying roll them out to a later date.
20121,"You’re almost certainly right, but we don’t know how the big shorts are positioning. Could moon higher before the real pullback."
20122,"Finally can afford to buy one share of GOOG. Ask me for investing advice, lads"

20135,Shoulda bought it at 1400 like me. fail
20136,So I’m not feeling good about my PLTR $30c 12/24’s
20137,"That would be great! I would personally be surprised if we got 1 seat which would make votes swingable, but wouldn’t change bills dying on 🐢s desk for all eternity."
20138,Which strikes are the orders coming in for?
20139,Can you still spread covid after having had it but testing negative?
20140,Some of you spam with emojis and it hurts my head on wsbsynth
20141,Can't wait to play the new Diablo phone game
20142,If it's big enough to screenshot it's time to sell...every time I've taken a screenshot within 1 week I lose 1/2 of my gains.  Lock in some profit.
20143,"I bought a few $35 March calls yesterday. Your timeframe may be more realistic though, lol."
20144,If cohen just announced a hostile take over of gme right now this sub would blow its collective load
20145,"you know I'm in around the same price and I almost sold then though...it's a young company. I'd rather short TSLA or some other bloated company. This price action is really odd, so I'm thinking it's either being bought out or the floor of like 20 is definitely in"

20154,So many with paperhands and a lot of people FOMO into different stocks just to fomo back when the stock they left fires of. No wonder there's so much loss porn
20155,"I'm in June 2021 35c, will probably roll forwards to 40c 2022 when available, seeing 50% returns so far"
20156,What are the first 5 letters of the Alphabet
20157,"GME just went to 21.99 and dropped right down, trying to keep it below 22"
20158,"Right, but every 5% daily move you want is $110 billion dollars. More money than the market cap of almost any company in existence. I’m just saying you can’t expect huge moves every day in a company this huge."
20159,So is this a good sq dip to buy? We have a toxic relationship
20160,I would say yes. If it fails Whoever gets pinned for not getting this aid to the people will have to do some serious PR

20176,"Lotto:  AMC, 6c @ 5 cents, 1/29/21 expiration   Recently AMC received funding for $100M but that's not enough. They need $750M more for the near term. IF they get this near term liquidity, AMC will rocket as they don't have to think of doing a bankruptcy. And buys enough time for Q2 2021 when vaccine penetration should help the theater business. I think an announcement of additional funding or heading to bankruptcy will happen soon.   It's a lotto, yes, but u never know 🤷🏻‍♂️ as the tradeoffs are there; good ""gamble"""
20177,Oh.. There is a lot of paperhands. If it wasn't the stock wouldn't move at all

20190,Which hands are more diamond?  PLTR or GME?
20191,FireEye just needs 50 more cents...and its a 10 bagger
20192,"Personally, I would exercise and hold. Then when the prices start to get close to the $30 range, write some short dated weekly OTM covered calls against them. Selling the calls could limit your gains if shares get called away, and potentially help shorts cover, but by the time we get above $30 and you are selling $40 CCs the squeeze will be on."

20202,oh shit is NY going to let fans for the Bills game as they long as they test negative?   I hate Coumo but thats a reasonable precaution.
20203,"ARKG doesn’t give a sweaty fuck.   Outperforming SPY by 12% this week, despite most companies in the ETF not being profitable at present, or really even having much of a revenue stream.   Pets.com was a scam, but a lot of people got rich off of it."
20204,"Can only buy options with settled funds on WB. Which is good, i’m impatient so I just end up buying shares.  ICLN / ARKK / ARKG is diverse enough, right?"

20213,"For sure, I think you're right. I'm checking the chart now and damn lol I thought it was done running. Oh well.   But for your sake, I hope it keeps going man!   I had a number in my head and I hit it so I got out which I never do and of course this time, it wasn't the right move lol"
20214,I sold some of my PLTR to buy more GME. What a crazy world.
20215,this is the play if you're not into staring at your broker all day. just give Cathie your cash and delete your phone.
20216,"no offense, but i don't care enough to check. its not a particularly unique thought, why are you surprised we both came up with it"
20217,Both are 💎💎
20218,Fuck it I'll buy 10
20219,They’re all dead
20220,Aren’t the shares massively diluted? Just trying to figure what it’d put them market cap wise.
20221,"spreads are generally theta neutral (and basically atm spreads like the 22/23 suggested) actually benefit from theta decay. picked mine up for 25 a spread, already at 37."
20222,Working for Apple now duh
20223,Can't wait to see the next GME YOLO update. That guy must be above 10M
20224,Hahaha 😂😂 such a lovely description
20225,Just diamond hands when it drops to 21.60 and you’ll probably make a buck
20226,Well damn. My 369 SPY call might be the first time a 0dte prints for me (Currently 0-5)
20227,"It’s likely to move quite a bit in Jan. Early in the month is the Washington post presentation with them on Covid, later in the month is software demo day. I’d say there’s almost a 0% chance PLTR stays flat over the next month."
20228,"I looked into opening a short position on GME - not because I want to actually short it, but because I wanted to see what interest rate I was quoted. Fidelity told me there were 0 shares available to short, and even if I could short it the interest rate was over 17%.  I agree with your point on risk. However, buying long-dated calls en masse can prompt the large MM's to buy even more shares to de-risk their short calls."
20229,Day trading Tesla puts. I feel like pressure will close it low. Am I crazy?
20230,I am starting to worry about those guys. Are they OK?
20231,You have to go longer towards NIO day on 1/9. Calls for 4-8 weeks out from that are ideal.
20232,It’s true haha. But I’m cautious cause this does seem too good to be true. By exp I think this can easily be $45-$50
20233,How many ark shares y’all got and which ones??
20234,Putting my entire financial future into palantir is only mildly worrying. I'm in it for the long haul
20235,"This 2k stimulus 'Christmas miracle' feels kinda cheesy, like they meant to do this the whole time so that all the politicians could look like heroes"
20236,Those strikes are a little high for me tbh. Simply because breakeven will be even worse.  Wouldn’t be remotely surprised if you hit it still but given how large of a position I put into it I’d rather be on the safer side

20435,Starting? You’re a bit slow huh
20436,Unless there’s a huge move over the weekend which would probably go against you in this case. But it resets every night to track the day and maintain leverage so it naturally decays in value on top of theta decay.
20437,$507 is really $5.07 to some people. It’s a scratch off

20446,Yes. Just set it and forget it for 3 months
20447,what are you writing
20448,Why ARCT drop so much today?
20449,I like seeing the Snek on GME comments.   It's like a bonus modifier to GME.
20450,"No, you're a simp"
20451,"Yeah, I sold at plus one or two percent, it just wasn't looking good."
20452,What’s NIO doing today. Thought it’d keep running up until Nio day.
20453,No but apparently you’re fucking stupid for asking that bro
20454,Putting a guy like Ryan Cohen in charge would be a great move. He's a disruptive innovator who understands e-commerce and how to beat Amazon. He's done it with Chewy and I don't doubt he could do a much better job than some boomer that thinks you can just pause your Nintendo.
20455,Well damn IPOC....
20456,"A major test is expected early next year when workers at one warehouse decide whether to unionize. The company has not faced a union election in the United States since 2014, and a “yes” vote would be the first ever for a U.S. Amazon facility.  This week and last, the RWDSU and Amazon negotiated the election terms. By Tuesday they agreed to have seasonal workers in the bargaining unit, as well as process assistants, whose inclusion the union had questioned for their supervisory authority, according to the election hearings presided by a government labor board. That board will set the election date.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-labor-yearend-focus-idCAKBN28X1BA"

20491,I'm a bit perplexed as to why it's down so much. Do people really think their work buyout was that bad of a move?
20492,told u guys oracle would rise exactly at 8:50 lmfao. I can't even believe I was right.
20493,Is FCEL a real stock now?

20499,Living up to my name. Sold purple yesterday morning so it could send it past $30  Bought fb and baba to crash them. Will let you know when I exit so you can catch the moon train
20500,How the hell did you manage to lose money on GameStop calls when it went up 30% in a week . We’re you counting on the 300% short squeeze to take place this week?
20501,Needed a pull back. Check the hourly.  Hopefully it bounces off the 50 tomorrow.

20531,"Tbh I don’t see them winning this, maybe they get unionized but companies like Amazon and soon to be Walmart are gonna somehow fuck over the unions and give them a shitty deal. Similar to how Amazon raised its minimum wage to 15$ and hour but fucked over its employees by removing bonuses and stock shares.   Ps. Amazon will somehow skyrocket or this news"
20532,you don't have the guts
20533,Buy high sell low at it’s finest
20534,Well looks like AAPL is back to theta fucking and for that I’m out   Fucking boomer stock
20535,JMIA might be a 10x play.. but probably dipping to 35 b4
20536,Did you notice the warehouse that wants to vote is in alabama? Not in a northern or midwest/western state. Whether or not they unionize I wonder if amazon cares.  Amazon doesn't have to bargain in good faith and an economic strike wouldn't affect them because you can easily find scab and then you don't have to rehire those strikers. It's only illegal when the strike is related to employment or UPL issues.
20537,Glad I got out of CRM yesterday 😃
20538,Gme movement was alot yesterday I had to put out almost 10 differnt orders before I found a taker.   I would place an order for calls than the stock would go up increasing the call price and no one was selling at the price I place the order for gotta cancel and retry till you find a seller.
20539,Oh god yes. I sold a 10 covered call. I’m kicking myself. Debating on buying it back and rolling out. I don’t do covered calls too often.

20544,"The big move out of the $80s was helped by rumors they would be working more with AMZN and MSFT.  Now those giants are working on their own shit without AMD.  AMD needs another catalyst which it might get at the CES, but definitely the next time they report earnings which I think is February.  AMD ain’t dead, it’ll be $100 in a month or two.  Any calls however expiring soon that were bought awhile ago... probably dead"
20545,Pump it tf up!!!!
20546,Microvision maybe. Down 20% could be in for a 10% bounce within a couple days

20555,DKNG - are you mooning for real this time or is this another fakeout?
20556,I'm a saas sales rep and everyone i speak to thinks its great.   i do too tbh. slack groups for prospects and us to communicate in and then having that stored in the opportunity automatically will be sick. i see potential for this merger  as for actual $CRM. i sold for a lost a while back. better use of that money elsewhere at this point imo

20567,Interesting. How is that kind of job? Is it easier to sell software as opposed to hardware?

20609,Wrong. It's still up 77% this week even after losing 20% today. Run up was insane with nothing to back it. Avoid.
20610,loaded up today. IV is low. will make +30% just by holding it

20615,This is hilarious. Not a fan of Pelosi but she called that retards bluff.
20616,AI dipped 15% this morning and is green on the day  What a monster
20617,Maybe.  I see the GA senate race being a factor here. Nancy wants the focus in $2k and a R loss. R might want the bigger picture and say whatever take the $2k but we can hold the Senate and take the house in 2022 and all it costs is a few hundred billion.   Or it's a tactic to get the amount back to $1200 and everyone comes off as a man/woman of the people

20635,That's retarded. I'm sitting on a bunch of pot plays but it's not the fucking internet.

21114,Sold AI at break even and missed 1k on the run up  I don't make all the right calls :)  Riding memes with short expirations and right when they open after a BIG day does seem to work though.

21116, G.H.I.V pumping!!!!
21117,"GME is burning out, people are in denial and are trying to squeeze the last few drops to make extra cash. GME is dying, it’s time to move on. Don’t get greedy."

21119,"Throwing $100 in something, give me play cause I’m bored. If you’re right I’ll Venmo u 10%"

21137,SOXL has returned 50% more than ARK in the last 5 years. How come you guys pumping ARK instead of them?
21138,"PLTR to 30 is like a girl talking about anal for the first time. Adamant against it, slaps you for suggesting it, but secretly kinda wants to try it and will cock tease you (29), but takes too fucking long to end this argument so you just end up nutting in 9.5 seconds in missionary as always (27 EOW)."
21139,“i’LL jUsT wAitT &amp; bUY tHE dIP”. Because the difference between $19.50 and $20 matters when it jumps to $30+ later.

21144,"You are not the only one brother, cheers. Kinda why I stick to buy and HOLDing now but did take some off the table today, oooops lol . We shall see bitch was up 27% today lol"
21145,"if you have something like $100k in unrealized gains, is it better to realize them in a single tax year or spread them out in 2 tax years if they are short term cap gains? Mainly looking at the federal tax brackets, but since it's a progressive tax system does it not matter at all?  Like if I cash everything out right now maybe it'll put me in the 35% tax bracket, but if I spread it out to 2 years maybe I'll be in the 32% tax bracket this year and 24% bracket next year which I think might be better?"
21146,"Everyone knows we are due for a correction, but everyone is so quick to buy the dip, that I feel like we may never get that correction. Monday looked like the apocalypse."

21152,It wouldn't be THAT crazy to see SPY open around 372 if rumors start floating that Mitch may actually sign the bill tonight?  Sure it will dump at open but I'm thinking couple hundred bucks worth of some 372 FDs may actually not be fully retarded
21153,"The one thing that I’ve learned about trading is that there’s no blood, no sweat, but a fuck ton of tears"
21154,Bought calls today that expire tommorow.  Is doing FDs on AMD the most WSB play ever

21384,I bought SOY as a joke and its my highest earning stock by percentage wtf
21385,Not the 31st since won’t settle until after the new year and it’s based off settlement date if I recall correctly.  Suppose the bigger question is whether or not it’s something you can hold to hit the long term cap gains instead.

21474,Gee. Already up $1.50. Must be a dumb play right you 🌈🐻?
21475,that means nothing without mentioning ROI. 2k on 400k is .5%. 2k on 2k is 100% a day.
21476,So I’ve been day trading for the last few months. Playing the diamond hand game now. I already know it’s going to test my willpower once things get rough. I’ve had a hell of a morning with my GME swings

21481,GME will end up outdated just like blockbuster. Most people will end up buying their physical products i.e consoles and accessories from traditional supermarket stores.    Don't fall for this bullshit.
21482,earlier i was like if AI dips again im gonna buy..now im like maybe ill wait for it to dip a little more
21483,I guess a lot of people saw it as an opportunity to sell. Thing pumped 3% and crashed back to what it was 10 min ago.

21486,"*EDUCATIONAL PSA*      When you see someone saying something like ""Ticker $LOWCAP is about to explode! Free money!""

""Time to sell GME gains for $LOWCAP""      ""$LOWCAP is about to go parabolic""      ""All in on $LOWCAP""      ""$LOWCAP &lt;appropriate emoji&gt;""       You're getting shilled / pumped on.

21494,"Do you think any of us retards really care. DD says it'll go up for a period of time, DD looking like it's right"

21507,why is mrna going up? i thought it was priced in
21508,I want to say around 12:50-55 PM ET
21509,The only way gme could be worth this valuation is if they started a sales service like steam or streaming service like stadia.  Just insane.  Gme is pumping off pure meme at this point.
21510,its obvious you either didnt understand or didnt read any of the DD posted around here
21511,"GME CCs are scary, I'll probz be more comfy with CSPs tbh"
21512,No they're averaging up (or down depending on how you view it) so their positions are less underwater.
21513,"Get in on MCFE today, $20 calls are dirt cheap"
21514,I’d still be careful of the pump n dump. Just trying to see what is a good news on gme.
21515,This isn’t the Christmas I envisaged when I started trading in July. Fml

21522,Are you in the US or in one of those countries with a GameStop?
21523,"KO has been almost perfectly flat since a couple days after the November election and it's still beneath its pre-pandemic high. It's a dying boomer company, so your calls might expire worthless anyway."
21524,Seems like a good play - they consistently have poor earnings
21525,Do it coward
21526,"Make of this what you will, my crayons tell me FB has a high likelihood of dumping in the next few days."
21527,"Don’t pick something ludicrous. I bought 12/31 23c this morning that printed hard, and that was pretty far OTM"
21528,All in GME. Plz don't disappoint
21529,Long-term your right. Theres a reason why some models of the new playstation and xbox dont even have disc drives. Console gaming is going to go the way of PC gaming (where I havent bought a physical disc in like 6 years)
21530,"this thread has become a worthless twat of babies saying either  1.  GME to the moon! 2. PLTR to the moon 3. ""X"" stock is doing ""Y"":  should I buy/sell? 4. Boomer suck, but thumb sucking kids should stick to sesame street and mom's milk."

21537,Do you really need to go to a store to buy most things? Transitioning to a digital store is bullish. They also are not in risk of going bankrupt right now like blockbuster was.

21552,"I kinda learned that 9 months ago.   This thread only talks about stocks that have already gone up and never mention legit plays that are ""going"" to go up. Nobody knows what they're doing.   I just learned to have fun with it and not use it for actual stock trading advice."

21699,First time hearing of this company. Big gains to expect soon? Or a long hold?
21700,Both of you are wrong. Shit isn’t breaking out until January 22. This is just a temp pump while some whales jump in while there is low volume cuz of Xmas.

21745,"Replace AAPL with BABA , BABA is undervalued"
21746,"Well, I've been holding GME since 13.55 so I'm not completely retarded (or maybe I am extremely retarded), but I have more faith in GME than I do PLTR to rocket in the next couple days. The breakeven on my PLTR calls was like $37 and rising, while I'm already ITM on my GME calls."

21755,AMZN 4200 by summer
21756,"So what you're saying is, all you have to do is buy longer expirations?"
21757,"Idk what to make of SQ. It's on my top 10 list of stocks to play but I can't draw a clear picture of where it will go. Its been straight vertical since the election, increasing over 50% in value and at an ATH literally every week. Its P/E ratio would lead me to believe it is incredibly overvalued yet I like it as a long term play with only a 100 billion market cap and no dividend."
21758,As a gay man I feel dirty being a retard bull. Need to go to grindr to fix this
21759,Am I retarded for buying that XL lunch time dip? Might just turn into a day long dip

21764,I need gold to run up juuuuuuuuuust a few percent for Christmas
21765,Do you think ryan is buying shares now just to dump it? He obviously sees a futures in gme and is trying to turn the business around. Gme has the cash flow to make the changes happen might not be the safest investment but the upside makes it worth it to throw abit of money at it. Not something i would yolo my live savings on tho.
21766,It's ok you can use my AMD contracts to wipe your buttt
21767,You guys convinced me to buy NAT at $6. It is currently $3....

21779,I could see it high 90s
21780,GME gang has gone quiet.
21781,PLTR teases my cock more than a Vegas stripper.  Both take my money and tell me they think I’m cute but end of the night (week) I’m just left by myself with my dick in my hand 😢
21782,"Crazy that a stock that went over 500% in 1 month could drop 13%. Buy that dip, easy money."
21783,Lol doing TA on a stock in gme's situation
21784,Fuel Cell is a money printer
21785,"Hahaha, kinda. Had a bunch of options from months ago. Sold the first set when it was up 450%. Held the other two up to 780% and 460%. Now they are both around 130ish% up. So bag holding lost gainz I guess. Overall worked out though."
21786,"ehh, I did too, lets hold it."

21788,whats the next stock we're going to make cramer bitch about?

21794,Lmao you have 1100 dollars in it and you’re talking big shit. Gtfo kid
21795,At what price is Nikola a buy?
21796,"Here is the deal with PLTR, and you can apply this to any tech related stock that isnt feeling the breakout.      Traditional VC finance regarding tech is bullshit and hasn't caught up to truth that even though a company, like PLTR, isn't ""profitable"" (as in their balance sheet doesn't show a positive cashflow over expenses) then creditors and rating groups like ""shitron"" or ""credit suisee"" will always be bearish on it.     Profitability is obviously very fucking important, but by the time you hop into a tech company that reported their first hard profitable quarter, the stock has already taken off.   Amazon, Tesla, Apple = all these companies were in the the red FOR YEARS. Amazon had serious issues gaining traction getting VC funding because despite experiencing strong growth and a stronger pull to profitability VCs discounted it ""bECauSe iT wAsN't pRofiTaBle"" because they forgot that as a company invests in its infrastructure, they streamline and become more viable.  Look at what happened to Tesla, Every VC saw their product. Despite some production flaws, a Tesla vehicle has the highest consumer approval rating in the automotive industry. They had 1 profitable quarter and the price fucking flew from 189 share price to 645.   Palantir has been around for a while, no argument about that. But the reason why they IPO'd so recently isn't a coincidence, they are becoming more and more profitable as quarters come by at a dramatic pace. This is especially true because they produce SOFTWARE. They have an insanely high market opportunity to grow into.   Don't sleep on it"
21797,Did you look at their balance sheet? They were undervalued anyway and now they have meme status too
21798,"Thank u Daddy, just bought some ARKF calls Strike $155, Exp April.  What are your ARK plays papa bear?"

21804,"My portfolio is sideways for the past couple hours, such a boring day."
21805,It must have been part of the stimulus package
21806,aren't we all young inside
21807,"Been hoping for a pullback to load up on palantir but I think I missed it, gonna start slowly adding"
21808,"How come we don't buy calls on VIX? It can never go to $0, so it's free money if you just hold until the next crash."
21809,"That’s what I’m saying, keep after it small street bets, but like you’re gonna sit on NKLA?"
21810,"if too many ppl bought 30cs, then its in the MM's best interest to keep it under 29.99."
21811,"Aww yeah man. I'm guessing you closed because it hit 185, which was considered by many to be the gap? Once it gap filled, I feel like it might have some resistance and move back down."

21877,"PLTR as a software company is the bull thesis, PLTR as an OR consulting firm is the flat or bear thesis. The volatility right now is partly on account of uncertainty over which kind of company PLTR will become."
21878,Earnings doubled for one quarter and now the stock price has more than quadrupled

21883,I’m surprised this stock doesn’t get more love around here simply because it’s a strip club but RICK has made me 3x since the middle of the summer on stocks alone.
21884,"Nah. Theres a GME right downtown. Walk past it every day. It's never busy, maybe 3-4 customers max. Employees just typical reddit mods (overweight, neckbeards, multiple hair colors, hate capitalism as they spend most of their time on games on smartphones.).   Then I think: if I want to buy a new PC/Xbox game where would I go? It sure as shit isn't GME."
21885,"If DKNG recent past is any indication, I should start taking profits right about now - $55 is kryptonite for Donkey."

21887,Ok TSLA calls are stressful rn because this could rip either way
21888,No shit. I'll give you gold if it breaks 30 in December.
21889,"ignoring the fact that the share offering does almost nothing to prevent the squeeze from taking place but i try not to factor the squeeze into my thesis. take a look at [chewy.com](https://chewy.com), the market cap is 45 billion.... its a fucking pet store!!!  then apply the same business acumen that achieved that to the gaming industry which happens to be the fastest growing industry and has a cash flow of about 50 billion per year. then imagine a scenario where GME can even grab 2-5% of that it would be a cash flow of 1.25 - 2.5 billion a year. do you have any idea what the market should be for a stock with that kind of cash flow? do you know what the share price would be?  keep in mind apple almost went out of business back in the day... amazon was just a book store at one point, this is an amazing opportunity"
21890,Why does it take an hour? And thank you for the reply I appreciate that
21891,Need PLTR to go back down to 25 or 26 so I can load up more!!!
21892,Shit is annoying. It rallies to $29 then goes down.
21893,Agreed. U think its still a solid buy at 28 rn? Or wait for dip

21902,"so you have to use it tomorrow? i dont see why not, you dont have go in at ALL. were as leaving early is cool, but you still gotta go in. but thats my opinion, since tomorrow is the last day. then just use it and enjoy not going in at all"

PLTR has still ben running hard because a lot of smarter VC's are seeing the gaps between profit margin and expense shrink   Don't fuck with options yet. Keep an eye on their earnings reports. I'm expecting them to have 1 or 2 more quarters being in the ""red"" but keep an eye on if the gap between profitable and not profitable  begins to shrink and you see their expenses reduce and their sales numbers increase.  Once that happens go very bullish"
21973,"at this point I've just got buy orders set at various levels, if they trigger they trigger. 20.11, 20.49, 21.00 etc if they dont fill today I'm sure we'll get a minor dip on a open/close when shorts make their next move/paper hands sell out before EOY."

21994,"His ""gf"" probably here and read all the roasts"
21995,John Najarian on CNBC mentioned he has Feb options at 22 strike for GME. Looks like shorts slapped it back down though. That or a hedge fund is ok selling when it touches 22.
21996,"Damn, I used to own 2000 AMD at $9 a share.   Sold it at $18 :(  (If I knew what I now now, I would've been a millionaire--said everyone ever)."

22011,So this is the christmas rally people were talking about? im fking green as fuck
22012,Ya I’m still learning about options but only shares so far. I got like 1.5k into pltr at 25 ish 2 weeks ago. I see its staying around 26-28. I was waiting for a dip but i guess its a long term investment and 28 is not bad since i see potential?
22013,Had BAC$30c 12/31. Sold a week before. Damn me and my paper hands.
22014,"My original plan was to use it Monday and get a 4.5-day weekend, but the last pay period of 2020 ends Sunday so I’d be using one of my six 2021 days off (of this type, I get like five different types of paid time off it’s ridiculous) on the first day of the year.  I guess you’re right, they’re use it or lose it anyway."

22087,"I was holding XLE shares but I swapped them out for CVX. The way I see it is big oil companies stand to benefit the most in the coming years. While XLE is a majority CVX and XOM, it’s also being weighed down by riskier companies. An increase in the price of oil will undoubtedly send XLE higher, but I feel as though it might lag behind XOM or CVX because of the dead weight it’s holding. All in all not a bad play though"

22125,"PLTR breakout, needs volume and it’s $30 eod"
22126,"Not a bad decision. But people are definitely too bearish on the lockup period ending.  The VC's and big money that got in aren't going to hop out now. They are invested in its growth potential and getting out now is like leaving first quarter of game 1.  Everyone, besides Soros (for ethical reasons) will be Hodling     Also consider that they will be expecting to have earnings on Febuary 11th. IF any investors are going to leave, it will be after then and if they have a dogshit earnings, which i do NOT expect given their recent contracts        ""Palantir Technologies last issued its earnings results on November 12th, 2020. The reported $0.09 EPS for the quarter, beating analysts' consensus estimates of $0.02 by $0.07. The business had revenue of $289.37 million for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $279.32 million. Its revenue for the quarter was up 51.9% compared to the same quarter last year. Palantir Technologies has generated $0.00 earnings per share over the last year. Palantir Technologies has not formally confirmed its next earnings publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday, February 11th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates."""
22127,"Someone posted this here yesterday and got kinda crapped on by people, so, let's just confirm it:     Sorrento (SRNE) will own approx. 2.5% of the new NK/Immunity Bio publicly traded enterprise.  They filed confirmation of that today:  [https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11806/html](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11806/html)     In today's dollars, at this moment in time, that stake is worth $140 million.     So, let me repeat, SRNE owns 2.5% of the new NK / Immunity Bio reverse merger and the 8.2 million shares of the public company they will hold is worth $140 million.  They were previously holding 10 mill shares of a private entity.     SRNE's cash burn has been approx. $20 mill per month.     Besides COVID diagnostics (STIX filed yesterday) and COVID drugs (multiple trials ongoing) to fund operations short term, SRNE can literally just unload its $140 mill NK / Immunity Bio stake to get 6+ months of working capital.  So no, they're not going to need to keep endlessly diluting as they work toward their path to profitability."

He can sit on it well past the Monday deadline and noone has a clue what his next steps are"""
22154,"So what I'm getting is 2k checks are unlikely because requires unanimous consent in senate (T/F)?   The stimmy passed with veto proof majority, so it will become law even if Trump doesn't sign (T/F)?  So we're still likely to get only $600 checks.  Am I wrong about any of this, thoughts?"

22202,Seems like it definitely bottomed at 91
22203,"Oh god fuck me. Do you think it's gonna reach 40 in jan, before possible dip in feb?"
22204,"Trump can still veto but do it in the last day of the 10 days he has after the bill is delivered. Under the current timeline, if he waits until the last day and veto the bill then there won’t be seated Congress (current one finishes on the 4th) so the bill becomes worthless as the congress can’t vote to over write the veto. New congress would have to take a “new” bill"

22385,"okay...learning as i go here: Daily Mail UK:   * **They passed the House 359-53 in the House and the Senate 91-7 - both veto-proof figures**  However, if Trump does not sign the bill before the legislative term ends , the bill dies regardless of veto or the fact it passed with a veto proof majority.  Today is the last day for them to delivery the legislation to trump to ensure he can't run out the clock.  So if they hand him the 5k page bill today, it should become law."

22399,"not an update but just an fyi:  It doesn't matter that stimulus/covid passed with a veto-proof majority because Trump can pocket veto this because Congress took too long.  It doesn't matter that the NDAA passed with a veto-proof majority because McCarthy/the House and GOP Senators have said they will sustain, not override his veto.    It's starting to come out today but if you've been following me since last week - it looks like Trump really is pissed enough at McConnell to tank any of the three bills to get section 230.   I'm glad we're up today in the market but holy shit I don't know how."

22405,I left that job to take another job that will net me around 60k a year. Everyone actually told me that I was making the right decision but I think it’s because they didn’t want me to move and because they saw I was unhappy. The more I look back on it the more I start to realize it was probably the wrong decision. I think if I would have went out of my comfort zone and moved I would be in a better place right now. I’ve considered trying to go back but I’m not sure if the same contractor will take me back

22420,I was hoping it go go 17-20 in next few weeks😭
22421,Right. Most R just voted yes to save political capital. They can pretend to give a fuck. Now with a veto watch the snakes pretend like it was a terrible bill
22422,It's not moving above $132 -\_-
22423,FB beaten up too much the last month. Bounce started this morning and IV is still low
22424,I need PLTR to come down to 27 for a minute real quick.. then you can continue going up

22461,"100% percent true.  But consider this. As their product becomes more streamlined, they will turn from consulting to software. That's what they are positioning themselves as. They are producing software for each facet of the public and private sector at consumer specifications, but as they grow and acquire more customers they will have more tools at their disposal to create specialized software significantly faster.  Gotham took 8 years for them to make   Foundry development took less than 3 years   Tiberius was produced in response to the pandemic  This transition is moving fast, they are definitely building ontop of previous work."

22815,So are LEAPS basically just options expiring in 1 year +?
22816,Im sitting outside one waiting for the barbershop to call me and tell me it's okay to come outside (covid nonsense).  In 20 minutes of sitting here I've seen 3 people walk nside the GME.

22828,If you’re feeling FOMO that they went $15-20. Then don’t.   If you’re expectations is for the squeeze then $5 doesn’t matter.   Does this help you?
22829,"that and we send a TON of money oversees, who knows wtf for.    Part of me assumes its to ""PROTECT FREEDOM"" by kicking everyones ass on their own turfs, it might make me feel a little better if that was the case because it would mean we're still on top, but I dont even know anymore     I'm starting to think that the USA is just being shaken down and robbed by just about everyone"
22830,Honestly I think there are better buys.
22831,Theory here: McConnell is f’d if he goes against Trump and the GOP and holds his ground on $600 stimmy. Giving the runoff in GA to dems and they legalize weed for sure

22833,why do i feel horrible when i lose money but feel nothing when i make it back and then some more?  like this is what i rightfully deserve so when i’m up i don’t feel anything....   is this a red flag for gambling addiction or the opposite

22840,I’m down 10% on some 12/31 $NET 83C’s I bought this morning - why did it choose today to be a piece of shit?
22841,"I put $30 into some way OTM 12/31 GME FD's lol  I hate having ""dust"" (leftover few bucks) hanging in my account, I look for little things to throw them in. Having a cash balance bothers me. I need to be balls deep at all times"
22842,XL just went to the moon and left G O E V in the dust. . .I guess I picked the wrong one to sell yesterday. . .

22850,Just looked at the SPY 1-year chart and felt a little tear come to my eye 😥  Anyone else suddenly get emotional like this? I just find it beautiful how resilient capitalism is in the face of a horde of commies and gay bears that would love to see this beautiful casino game destroyed
22851,Thanks for confirming the bias this sub has
22852,"Imagine wanting red days going into Xmas of all fucking days.  Look, I buy call AND put options depending on the circumstances.  But if you want red days going into fucking CHRISTMAS? Gdamn, you need to step the fuck away from your computer and trading for a couple of days because you need to re-evaluate you gdamn life."
22853,They’re going to announce something ... I’m just guessing
22854,No idea but it’s up 4.5% LOL
22855,"Building up some NIO calls. NIO day Jan 9th, rumors of a TSLA sedan competitor, lots of 58c buying"
22856,"weird stock, but $BBTV is the second biggest company in this space behind Google. in the world.

Recent IPO.   &amp;#x200B;  This is a bagger. I could be wrong though. Can you guys have a look? Its a weird fucking stock"
22857,It means you are equating losing trades with mistakes.  A losing trade isn't necessarily a mistake.
22858,"I can't, sorry."
22859,Seems like another dump would have happened by now if it was coming.  Power hour pump?
22860,You guys see GM announce an EV?
22861,Just DCA into it. This thing is definitely worth 2x the current trading price.
22862,"I sure hope so. If that happens, I'll prob take profits on 2/3 and let the rest ride out to see if it squeezes tomorrow."
22863,"More than 1 Million people have got the vaccine. In 3 weeks, when these people get a second shot, they will be free to roam the country. Calls on Oil and Airlines."
22864,Lol your such a boomer. They use all kinds of artificial intelligence (Ai is not one specific technology) to solve problems using large amounts of data. For example oil companies just started using artificial intelligence to find more profitable spots to drill.
22865,My only regret is not buying a shit ton more SRNE options.  Still up bigly tho so I'm ok widdit (:
22866,I just got a magin call for not being diversified enough

22870,I heard Santa's cumming a slaying.
22871,"Fuck, I wish I hadn't looked at LMND. My 5 bagger was 3x1/15 90c. I'm not going to even look to see what they are worth now, lol.  EVER was prime for launch but the fucking CEO kicked the bucket and it dumped at the end of November! It's making it's way back up now, I don't expect the valuation of LMND, but with their performance I expect ATH in January as soon as people catch on."
22872,"nope, just have stonks lol so Don't care. Got to bleed them shorts! either coiling up or blasting up. No dumping tho"
22873,Come on retards were so close to $22
22874,CRM went back to the boomers

22885,Ton of 60c 12/31 were bought last week.   They did have that announcement that didn't seem to do much.  Not sure if that's it or something else is coming out.

22887,"Businesses and shit will still be closed/limited capacity until at least the summer. Sure you can be vaxxed early, but most people aren't so the world isn't going to be accommodating to you  Must feel REALLY fucking good to finally go outside without a mask though"

22890,Exactly. You know what’s up.  See you in Valhalla

22894,Gonna be a lot of GME bagholders in 2021 :(
22895,you're making a personal attack because you have nothing to contribute to this convo  eat a dick
22896,"They are all gonna share it. GameStop already has a huge online presence. And they have a huge base and a recognizable name. Honestly, as much as it seemed like they’d go bankrupt, it’s not unrealistic that they can continue to compete while lowering their physical store footprint as leases expire"
22897,Volume for GME has been HUGE these past couple days
22898,Dude it already broke major resistance at 130 you expect it to fucking moon 5% every day? It aapl bruh 2 tril market cap dont move like that
22899,"The daily chart, weekly chart and monthly look similar. Higher highs, lower lows. Yes it seems ""stuck"" at 29 today, earlier this week was ""stuck"" at 28, and 27 before that, etc. And each floor rises as well. Its called a trend and it is going up. Get on board and ride to tendie town"

22901,"For real.🦋🦋 Those of us who've been waiting patiently with warrants\shares gonna be feasting. It's barely began for LGVW. Best part of today wasn't even necessarily the rippage, but that it got options. Keep an eye on RBAC if you want too, though that one could take months."
22902,HTB fee varies depending on the stock and supply of shares to short.  What stock are you looking at?
22903,Rtx?
22904,"Not much further downside. Double down if you must, this company won't go bankrupt in J Pow's world."
22905,probably just forming a cup and handle (over the last few weeks) in anticipation of Q1 announcement

22917,"whats going on here with $PSTH, did ackman leak to a hooker or what"
22918,Didn’t think wfc had the juice.  Missed out on a 8 bagger by selling this morning.
22919,"Yeah so basically mortgage forbearance programs suspended mortgage payments. People who rent pay landlords and the landlords pay the mortgages. Pretty common practice in RE investment is the brrrrrr method where you get into a place and between the FCF and gained equity, eventually you cash out refinance and get more property... rinse and repeat. You can leverage very easily. The issue is if your tenants stop paying and you can’t float the mortgage then you will obviously get foreclosed on. Congress froze the requirement on federal loans so you don’t have to pay and the mortgage is deferred. The liability is the mortgage payments and once that forbearance program ends... there’s a lot of people behind on their mortgages. The banks have to make money so they can move to foreclose and evict people to short sell the property and recover their money because it’s a liability for them as well. We’re practicing setting up a mini 2008 for housing right now if this doesn’t pass and no executive order is placed. However banks could be willing to work with people, but that’s up to them."
22920,Can anybody actually explain to me why salesforce is CRM and not SF/SALE/SFRC or smth like that. Always reminds me of Cramer
22921,"Yeah, but you're missing my original point. The point wasn't that the new variants are/aren't threatening. Basic epidemiology ascertain that mutations become more virulent but less lethal over time.   The main takeaway is that in the short term a more virulent strain could be troublesome and lead to talks of precautionary lockdown measures even as we proceed with vaccine rollout. This is beneficial for ZM."

22929,How do y'all feel about TSM?
22930,Don't. This is not going to last forever. And when you start losing you're going to feel so much anxiety knowing your capital is shrinking making it harder to make it back. Better to try and get yourself a better career while you do this.

22935,You mentioned shares so I assume you’re a boring boomer. GM is right up your alley.  No but really Bloomberg just reported that they’ll be revealing an electric Chevy pickup in January. You could probably make a good chunk of change buying and holding for one month.  I myself bought 20x $44 12/31 calls for .23 a piece.

23057,Yep likely someone bought a ton and then a lot of bag holders decided to sell
23058,I got $175 calls last week for Feb 19th and cashed them out today for ~110% profits. I want to roll over the principle to a farther strike like $195 or $200 for the same date.   I too think that it will go back to pre dump levels of $190-$210. This past week it has taken a few steps up and has moved quicker than I expected so I too feel that there could be a pull back but at the same time it could just keep going back to previous levels without a pull back. It has done it before.   I am surprised not a lot of people are playing SPLK. It was an obvious play after that earnings dump and IV is low.

Especially if they did something like same day delivery for $5 from their local store etc. or even better, free delivery from the local store for annual gamepass members.

23127,"AAPL EV is good for Tesla  **Unless any of you guys think that another electric vehicle company is going to be able to produce higher quality cars at a lower cost than Tesla which I think is exceedingly unlikely, then all news of competitor electric vehicles should be treated as a positive. Here’s why: **  For Tesla, **Dominating the electric vehicle market right now is far less important than hastening the transition to an electric automotive market.** Every electric vehicle that comes out , Especially if an Apple vehicle comes out, normalizes the concept and reality of electric vehicles for the American consumer. It makes them more comfortable with it. Big brand names with consumer trust like the legacy auto manufacturers and Apple instill confidence in electric vehicle purchases for the average American.    **Therefore, if tesla can retain the edge and remain the best electric vehicle manufactured at the lowest price, they stand up from facilitated American adoption of electrical transport.**  Currently, tesla enjoys that very same status. Tesla reigns supreme within the electric vehicle sector right now. I think that is likely to stay…   - The manufacturing advances they are making with the model Y (casting machine) and the cybertruck, (folding chassis) and The new battery design, which is designed in order to enable very cheap, mass manufacturing, are unlikely to be challenged by any electric vehicle competitor from a cost basis. Tesla is going to source its own raw materials for batteries for the most part, whereas their competitors are going to have to buy from third-party.   - unlike other car companies, Tesla doesn’t have entrenched unions, it doesn’t have colossal amounts of debt, it doesn’t have an entrenched dealership network opposed to electric vehicle adoption.  - unlike Apple and other electric vehicle start ups, tesla already has brand name recognition, a Pan-American repair and delivery network  - Tesla technology lead to pack right now. People have been saying for years that a Tesla killer was on the horizon. Currently not exists. Tesla had the first mover advantage of moving from a luxury, to semi luxury, to main stream car in order to facilitate their growth. Other companies don’t have this luxury, they have to produce a car competitive with the model Y and the model3 immediately, but without the strong internal engineering capacity while having to source parts including batteries and components from third parties.   **I genuinely don’t see a path to success for competitors outside of smaller niche market like small transport, vans, traditional truck designs, that sort of thing. I think Tesla has such a lead at the moment, that they are in the process of juicing the most out of capital expenses, their technology is so far ahead in terms of efficiency and cost, that they absolutely stand to benefit from competitor vehicles.**  In fact, I think the worst case scenario is that the entire auto sector ignores Tesla and continues business as usual, not normalizing electric vehicle ownership and letting Tesla be lord of a little kingdom rather than a prominent player in the entire auto sector.  One thing you guys need to keep in mind is that the current share price is, obviously, directly tied to future sales estimates. I genuinely think these are conservative. If the transition to an electric car market is hastened for the majority of Americans, and test the remains number one, the current number projections are exceedingly low. Especially when you factor in the profit margin on Tesla insurance, full self driving subscription, among others."

23187,Update:  POTUS is expected to veto the NDAA prior to leaving for Maraloga at 3PM CST.  Has press pool  on his schedule at 2PM but he normally only does that so the cameras come.  He's scheduled to be back at the White House on January 1st.  He can sign or do whatever from Mar-A-Lago so NDAA might be vetoed in Florida but he's expected to do it before he leaves.  -\_- i honestly wish i was smart enough to interpret this into some sort of play but the market being up today has me all kinds of fucked up

23206,Retards when GME jumps 30% in a day: when should I FOMO in?  Retards when GME is mildly up: GME is for Losers.  I think the GME play isn't for the bulk of the people here.

23220,Can't argue with that

23245,GME y u do me like dis
23246,Yeah I'm keeping a close watch on how this 3pm House GOP call goes. There's a chance things could get really ugly that will overpower volatility oversupply and accelerated vanna flows. I'd still like to wait til end of next week to go long on VIX but we'll see
23247,"Looking ahead a few years, best to dump a ton of $ into SPY or AMZN or AAPL? Would rather not be checking my account every 30 minutes!"
23248,it's on the cusp of being over $1b Market cap. so it probably goes in and out of being blocked.

23260,Welcome to the light side. :) Spreads make up 90% of my trading and it’s immensely profitable and far less stress. Every time I post trying to convince others of that it’s met with crickets. I’m glad somebody saw the light. :)
23261,For real. Buy the dip.  People think that Chewy can't compete with AMZN but Chewy is very attractive for pet owners as it feels like a whole different experience.

23263,"Hitcha.. if it makes u feel better, I’m still buying XL @ this level 😂 quadruple up baby"
23264,Consolidating? The only thing I see is it continuing upward.
23265,I feel like a boomer gambling on SPY and NIO FDs lol
23266,No one uses weedmaps.  I dont even use leafly anymore.  Most stores have their own website and menu because weedmaps and leafly suck so hard.
23267,That’s too low
23268,plot twist and republicans deny it

23274,"C'mon Nio, finish the day strong.  We have big things planned for you these next couple weeks. 👌👌"
23275,"Yeah, but look at the year after each market crash 2000, 2008... those are the largest jump ups."
23276,When robinhood doesn’t fill your order so you make another then both them fill and you end up with both options rapidly losing their value 🤡
23277,just beware of wide bid ask spreads. Just because you got filled on the way in don't mean you get filled on the way out.
23278,My GME shares are safely locked in the core of a neutron star.
23279,My cost basis on MGNI is $5.66  Two months ago I bought a couple calls for March at $7.50  Sold them last month for about $330 each (about a 220% return). They're up over $2k now.   F.
23280,"My casual “let’s see what happens” XL $30 call I bought for $0.95 this morning is now worth $6.00. Lord, why didn’t I just YOLO everything?"

23282,"CRM jumped to $233 this morning, then dropped to $228 as the boomers rotated into cyclicals.  You might catch another jump if you buy a 1dte or 9dte now.  I'm holding Feb $250 calls myself. It was in the $260s before the Slack acquisition.  Not sure if old news."
23283,It’s been time bröther
23284,"13D only needs to be amended for a 1% or greater change in overall ownership (of the total float). Look at his buys early in the week vs later in the week. Tuesday/Wednesday combined was only 475k shares or  0.6% increase. He didn't cross the 1% threshold until Thursday 12/17 which gives him 2 business days to file, meaning he had to file by Monday 12/21. So if he took big positions (70k+ shares) Monday/Tuesday, he'd have to file by the end of the week. Or at the latest by Monday, depending if Christmas Eve is a business day or not, I don't know."
23285,March calls. Moneys from my past PLTR and TSLA gains. It’s still substantially less than my TSLA position
23286,"What are the catalyst. I’ve made so much money off FCEL shares, but always looked at it as a daily scalp. Is this a hold?"
23287,"Curious to know if folks are in PSLDX. As far as I see, they’re borrowing at the LIBOR rate to invest in bonds and stocks, essentially giving you a 2x leveraged 50/50 stocks/bonds portfolio. If PSLDX were to fail, wouldn’t the theory that stocks/bonds held in an appropriate allocation would also fail as a theory? What am I missing?"
23288,GME is the big hurt unless swing trading it.
23289,"It's a roller coaster, weeeeee!"
23290,Buying the NET dip has worked out very well in my experience
23291,Lmao I was hoping it was stripe when they were floating that around but fuck I dunno what they will do
23292,AAPL
23293,This is the one! I mean how sleep can you be people *G-H-I-V*
23294,Can AAPL do its expected run-up towards earnings please. Hoping for a rally tmr
23295,BABA!!! It bounced off 252-253 again. If that breaks we fuk’d.
23296,Red days are illegal now. Cant even refill my calls anymore
23297,Holiday weeks are just completely anemic. Almost not even worth the time.
23298,Any catalysts? Or reasons to believe it will return to its highs?
23299,"Someone who doesn’t have TSLA options are you thinking flat, pump, or dump into close?"
23300,Can’t wait til some fraud with a bunch of investors starts a nuclear vehicle company and the EV bubble pops
23301,"Ok wow, thats pretty much just as bad as I had imagined it to be.     Do you think this is gonna be a ticking time bomb, or are these measures gonna be enough to turn the situation around?   I mean, eviction extensions and liability protections are nice, but at some point the rents and mortgages must be paid right or is there much much more that goes into this?"
23302,I think it's just people getting in before xmas for the Q1 announcement.
23303,icln'd out bank accounts of anyone who fomo'd into calls at open damn
23304,Short it pussy
23305,XL calls gonna print if I buy now?
23306,CERTARA anybody?  Wait until you see it in Cathys portfolio
23307,I have exactly $0.09 of buying power left. Everything’s in mid/long term plays but I can’t seem to stop compulsively checking my damn phone. Dropped my last 20k on the GME dip at $20.75  Houstoooon we got a gambling problem
23308,"You seem like a cool customer. Only the most logical picks then?   Actually I bought stocks and they are up 25%. Why are you so mad, I just thought you would like to know that Ryan Cohen is at gme not Michael."
23309,They're impatient and are not true GME gang
23310,you guys don't realize that all that the past day gains have been on  low low volume. no one is going to open long positions at the end of the year but retailers
23311,"Can't think of any downsides for this 2k check. The Dems want it, the Republicans want it so that they're odds in Georgia don't worsen and even the president wants it."
23312,Both TSLA calls and puts are down today. Fuck
23313,Got see all the bagholders rage posting in the stickied DD about GME squeeze being bullshit lmao.

23318,10% is good  once you do all the math to get the net gains of most people here its negative (including me right now)
23319,gay bears coming out of the den from -2% when it's still up 8% nice.
23320,Already ran up like a christmas miracle what more you want you greedy fuk
23321,To avoid it you’d have to enter a different limit buy price and wait to get your order filled. I try to not stress too much about the minuscule amount I lose by meeting ask prices when buying and meeting bid prices when selling.   Btw I just realized I said it backwards. You meet the ask price when buying if you want the order filled immediately.
23322,Forward diligence. Its when you focus your dd on the rate at which revenue grows rather than balance sheet stuff like cash and debt.
23323,I hope so.
23324,"AAPL leaps, sell calls against position if you want."
23325,When we buying XL puts? When it hits Citron's $60 tgt? ;)

23331,All in short then
23332,"yeah, GME is probably having Jeffries dilluting shares now that the price is high"
23333,Come the fuck on SPY. Why you gotta be do afraid of 370 during market hours? Guess I need to wait for futures to break it through again
23334,At least it wasn't her skanky cousin Kandi.
23335,Do it GME go below 20 I will buy 10k more shares. I'll fucking do it again
23336,But it'll cut into the Pakistani gender education budget though
23337,The gop doesn’t want it
23338,Cash is definitely tight these days. Balls to the wall bet on a melt up. Essentially no dry powder left. Think it’s going to be a happy January though :)
23339,I can’t see that not hitting.  I’ve got 12/31 30c lol
23340,FEYE leaps up 45%  GME shares up 8% PLTR shares up 3%   Had TSLA FD 655c that was up 200% when I sold   Have a couple losers too but they are 6 months out so not concerned at the moment

You can try getting in on low IV for an IV spike like an insta sell/buy off, but its high risk."
23368,i bought a call today after it dumped  imo it's going back above 400
23369,Why do you guys think GME is a good buy?

23472,"Well I’m not professional here. I am studying RE in my state which require 180hrs of course work.. but my guess is some of it is a ticking time bomb while others not so much. All the small time investors with maybe a few properties are likely hurting and bad. These guys typically house hack and can’t afford their own home without the renter paying. The bigger guys have so many doors and there are still a decent amount of renters who are paying tbh. The unfortunate part is some people have taken advantage of the rent forbearance. I’m sure there are several people who could afford pay their rent in full in time but neglected to because they have zero fear of being evicted right now. Federal law prevents anyone from just magically getting free rent and that money is owed to the landlord. There’s no getting around this. The issue is even if they pay that eventually over time, does that prevent the foreclosing of the property they are renting?"
23473,Citron PT of $60 on XL. Pumping to dump their position? Just about every short call they made has gone the other way. NIO PLTR for example. The only one they got right was Luckin

23645,should have put all my savings in it since i started trading and delete the fk app. Woulda been a millionaire by now smh
23646,Pump. This is fear mongering right now
23647,"He doesn't even know the full story and reasoning behind why the shares are undervalued, even after this pump based on fundamentals alone.   GME is bringing out the real tards, as well as what seems to be fake ass accounts."
23648,damn I’m so happy about PLTR. it’s up 3.37%   *looks up XL cuz everyone is talking about it*   WTF 🤬
23649,Best part of TA is you don’t find out until after it’s actually happened.

23656,It’s up 3.5%

23671,YAASS.  My EV analysis is spot on.  First QS now SBE.  SBE is easy money.  Biden and Mayor Pete have declared 500000 charging station.  Chargepoint will get a big order from the government for Level 2 charging station!  SBE is the next bubble.
23672,Fsr waiting for tesla final hour move to either rocket up to 21 dollars or back down to 14. Feels like theres gunna be a big move here soon

23711,I have a 2080ti.   I wouldn’t buy a 3000 series from a scalper. I don’t give a shit about the price. That’s someone who is purposefully ripping you off and you’re paying for it. I just am not willing to do that. Scalpers can choke on a dick man.

23715,Y’all keep saying this and I listen for some reason and nothing ends up happening and I lose money 😂
23716,Lol all you new traders are going to have a hard time next year when stocks stabilize. Pltr is up 3% today and you're saying it doesn't move. In normal times a 3% movement could take a year.
23717,"Gambling on SPY means you’re buying short dated options.  Buying long dates calls on a previous closing high follow a drop = money. Not a lot.

23763,Bruh... blows my fucking mind that there are people who see NKLA and think it’s a good idea to buy
23764,"People say a lot of things. I'm not selling tho, but keep it in mind."
23765,I’m a late arrival but locked and loaded.  I’m not selling until GME hits $40 and even then all I’ll do is roll my calls to a later date and higher strike.
23766,Ya I just do 300-400 here and there buy I did lose 15k a couple weeks ago on it too. Need to just stay away as literally all my other plays have been solid. I just get this stupid itch for SPY and can't explain it

23778,don't get greedy
23779,"Someday spacs won’t be free money, but today is not that day"
23780,Its definitely a patience vs instant gratification thing.  3080's wont be near calming down until at least mid next year.  I upgraded from an i5 and Nvidia 970 to a AMD 5800x and 3080 and only paid +$300 more from MSRP. But I was tired of waiting and now I have a minimum 7 year high-end PC.
23781,I’m using margin on fidelity but the margin interest accrued is $0? Anyone know why?  Does margin interest only kick in if you’re below the 50% line?

Each warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination or 12 months from the closing of this offering and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

23832,Done. People are already taking their vaccine
23833,"All OG Tuscan Riders holding through merger, correct?"
23834,"In my particular case I've been using them on SPACS. I buy some underlying in the companies that I like but in WSB mode where I'm just buying naked options it would work like this:  SPAC is trading close to NAV. (10 to 11ish). I buy 1 or 2 month options for 12.50. Stock sits and then finally churns on news or time to its confirmed merger date.   Stock goes up 5 or 10 percent. I then sell an equal amount of calls with the same strike date 1 or 2 tiers above mine. The existing calls I have act as collateral so that I can sell calls. Each call I own paired with a sold call is a debit spread.   Now, if the stock continues to go up, my spread will go up but will be capped in profit at the difference between the strikes.   If the stock turns down, I'll lose money on my original call, but the contract I sold will gain value. This allows you to do two things in the future.   1. Buy out the call you sold for a profit, thus going back to naked calls.   2. Close the spread by buying back the sold call and selling the call I own.   It just helps to lock in profit without using a day trade while also leaving the window open to keep the original call without worrying as much about the whole position biting the dust and losing everything."
23835,My guess is that you literally just bought on margin. Settlement takes T+2. So that's when you start accruing. Same logic applied when you sell. And it also accrues on weekends

23883,"How many shares do you have? Currently up 250 today off my 75 shares so I'm not complaining, just was hoping for a bit more of an increase."
23884,"Ryan Cohen filing a 13-D, Hedgeye putting it on their best ideas list and the subsequent short covering from those 2 events was the reason the stock went up.   The stock didn't go up because it had to fill a certain pattern. All that matters in TA is support, resistance, price and volume.   No one ever talks about the 90% of cup and handles that either do not materialize or simply fall apart and the stock crumbles."
23885,Tomorrow are we uppies or downies ?
23886,"I thought it was lock up period ending, profit taking?"

I even bothered to write up some smart people reasons for it, but all the WSB short bus tards just downvoted it and talked shit.  3 days later VIX is back down to the same levels as it was last Friday.  Short VIX plays printed 200%+ in a few days while you retards bought SPY puts and got IV crushed.  Sadly you cannot fix stupid."
23893,I sold at $15 like a bitch
23894,Thanks! Put some money in gnrs @ 10   Will have to do some dd on gix as it's already up a lot today
23895,Why won’t my option fill if there’s people bidding at my ask price
23896,Is FCEL a safe hold overnight?

23924,SQ usually always pulls back like ~3-7% then will go +10-15 the next couple days. Been like that all year.
23925,Yea I understand that but I bought 3 days ago so I figured it should reflect it already
23926,SPACs literally can't go tits up

23945,Wait till NIO day and see it climbing it’s way out of a mountain lol
23946,Might as well. I bought calls. Gauranteed to reverse as SPY is a fucking POS. Hate it so much
23947,Not aware of the lock up. Could also be a factor. I thought the reason why they're down is because BMO downgraded them.
23948,I got in also same dates.  Are you holding?
23949,Alright PLTR... you’re on the clock!🚀🚀🚀
23950,came back from a b8 wtf is this shit

23964,"That's basically what I've been telling myself, is it's just not my time yet. As well as testing that patience, and not being absorbed by 'shoulda coulda woulda' like emotions. I know I posted about it which is hypocritical to what I just said, but I've had nothing to post about in weeks. Holding as long as I have to. Anyways I digress."

23982,Oh fuck the Wall Street chads are back from chipotle
23983,NKLA...epic pump &amp; dump
23984,"Started day down 2%, was up 10% for the day for a very short bit. Will finish up 1%🤡🤡"

23986,"it trades in ranges for months, this is typical."
23987,"Load up for NIO. I repeat, load up for NIO. Going to shoot up to 65-70 next week. Don’t get left behind."
23988,That's why do covered. It's safer than owning the shares outright even
23989,"Hmm, I must say.. this does look like a decent idea.  Not often I actually open a position based on a post I see here"
23990,"Fuck yes my fellow TOS brother.  Let’s get this bread.  Also I know you’re a little red, it happens, just refueling the rocketship."

23996,GME +50% this week. You think that's sustainable without even a small pullback?
23997,"Now that I am in my full position yes, let's do that! More Thiel goodness."
23998,"Everyone was upset abt only 600$. Orange says he wants more and now everyone is mad about him doing it too late, other agendas, etc. Damned if you do damned if you dont"
23999,I started maxing last year.   I thought argument for Roth is you pay the tax now and so when you’re older and presumably wealthier you aren’t getting taxed on it?

24013,"Pavlovian response when it comes to Orange Man, very sad to see"
24014,"For the sad $GOEV folks watching $XL...I want to remind you of this:  **Canoo - Alex Marcinkowski, Head of Corporate Strategy (September 15, 2020)**  ....On the latter part of your question, are ***we looking to potentially supply the Ubers, Lyfts, DiDis of the world*** with our vehicles? It's definitely on our radar and I think anybody can look at our initial vehicle design and say that it lends itself perfectly to ride share. And it does. We can't deny that. It is definitely kind of one of our longer upside business opportunities. Especially when you put in an Uber Black or one of the premium ride share programs, I think that we'd do incredibly well there. ***And we are in some preliminary discussions with those folks today***\*.\* Obviously, we can't go into too many details, but definitely a core part of our consumer offering will be working with big guys like those, and especially also internationally. I highlight DiDi as well just because they're frankly the biggest of the three."
24015,I thought argument for Roth is you pay the tax now and so when you’re older and presumably wealthier you aren’t getting taxed on it?

Meanwhile HTZ goes bankrupt, but at least they own a physical fleet of cars that are worth something.  How is NKLA not below HTZ yet?"

24100,but dis spent a shit ton of money on that content so profits will take much longer
24101,Netflix still has the aura of some fancy future tech company so they are allowed to have a crazy market cap. Never mind that the Netflix of today is basically no different than any other run of the mill network with a streaming platform.

24111,THICB WE ARE THE DA NOW
24112,I sold 30. It's amazing how iv is still high. Those are not dropping as fast as I expected.
24113,Where are the algo tantrums. Bullshit
24114,Bubbles don’t always pop. Sometimes they float up into the air
24115,I’ll follow Cathie Wood thru hell and tendie town and back thru hell again if she so promises to unshackle me from this pitiful wage cuck existence
24116,Yes. Thats why you will get fucked when we have a correction
24117,the graphics are next gen.
24118,"GME dying the slow death before MM give it that EOD curb stomp, rip pumpers"
24119,PLTR flatter than your sisters chest all week. Sad!
24120,I’m balls deep in 1dte spy puts. Either I go big and cash out or go out with a bang. I’m also tired of the game
24121,Its not a bubble bro. Its the future
24122,Yes I do and made nice tendies the first time it hit $17+. Still holding warrants. Thanks for the awesome DD bro and merry Christmas
24123,I left a 0 out of 5 star review on one of their sectional couches
24124,That was the problem. I don't play in this space at all. Pharma and weed I feel like I need to really deep dive in before I have a clue.
24125,I’ve been eyeing up those March 5c all day...
24126,Trading used to make me so happy when I first started with just small gains and small losses and I’ve been doing it for a while now and now it’s big gains and big losses but the past 3 weeks have just not gone good
24127,"In hindsight, that seems like a very poor trade"
24128,Whoever is buying THCB and THCBW is gambling that they will agree to merge. Lots of ROPE sales when they don't agree.
24129,Anyone bored and wanna give me a 10 minute explanation on spreads? I won’t pay you but you can feel safe knowing that you spent your time productively educating someone
24130,Will msft ever break its resistance?
24131,Probably because it’s trading at thousands of times earnings.
24132,ZM has no moat at all. any company at all can do what it does. not worth keeping long-term.
24133,"I can always tell when my friend is jealous of my positions when he starts trying to “help” me. Today it was a link about how “gambling” will give me a heroin addiction. Mfer I told you to buy more than 4 GME shares over a month ago, your fault you’re not up 60% this week"
24134,Damn amazon gave me 1 day free shipping on a last minute gift.   How is amazon not at 5k???
24135,"Large institutions haven't been able to purchase as much as they wanted to with the direct listing. Retail piled in and has a lot more than usual for brand new tickers.   It's trading very technically, but slowly rising due to legit intrest from retail and big players, hence why ARKG and others are buying in on dips."
24136,Do it. I bought it two days ago and it’s treating me well
24137,Inversing doesn’t work because calls/puts both usually expire worthless
24138,Doubt it will happen tomorrow if it didn’t happen yet with the 2 news releases this week
24139,Any DD on Evo Payments? Can it be the next SQ?
24140,Russell put is so mother fucking tempting at this point but I vowed myself not to buy anymore puts on Russell because it just burned my money the last couple times I tried to short this   Update: I just fucking did it again oh god lol
24141,"Ya'll really like linking to yourself from this morning and saying ""I told you so."" huh?"
24142,"Most everyone who bought is looking for more upside, most everyone who wants to bail already bailed in the first 20 minutes. The few who wanted to sell at $29 but missed the chance are now selling to the few buyers who see $29 as a launching pad for $33 next week, but are late to the party"
24143,"PERI with more revenue and profit than MGNI and 1/10th the current market cap of MGNI. Float of less than 25 million shares as well. Even with this week’s run, it ain’t even close to    done. I’m loading every dip."
24144,"Approaching 52wk low on TSLA IV, what's the play? Long ATM straddle and hope it reverts rather than sets a new low? Anything with positive Vega right?"
24145,All SPACs popped today. Maybe slight risk off move? Who knows
24146,Back in? Why would a business that relies on selling digital media on physical DVD's in physical stores like its God damn 2004 ever have a future? This squeeze will last as long as it lasts and the bag-holding will be epic.
24147,"Every time VIX jumps above 25, short it. It usually comes back down within 1-2 days."
24148,I hate that fucking company. It can’t even sell trash to a garbage company. Fun fact if you bought nkla shares and held for a month at anytime in its history you are down 40-50%. Just get delisted already
24149,Why would you take profits of literally $40 are you working with &gt;$200 total?????
24150,didn't know you could give a 0 star review

24155,This is what we say until it pops
24156,What's your PT for Tuscan? Your DD has made me quite some money
24157,Usually does. Added some shares for XPEV as well just in case. 1 month chart is pointing to a big run up imo
24158,I got 500 shares at right below 11 thanks to the DD post.  Holding for awhile.
24159,"you made a lot still, don't sweat"
24160,up $5 and change today - not bad at all after sinking like a rock this week
24161,We are up like 9% on the week ???
24162,"so i don’t need to set a stop loss or any sort like that, if i were to just leave it, i’d eventually either make money or lose the 20$"
24163,Biggest regrets is only putting like 300 into 🐝 warrants when they were 1.50 each.  Shit’s been nearly a quadruple bagger for me. Barely knew fuck all about warrants at the time so I felt like playing it safer
24164,"XL was a good ride .... whew   I’ll pick it up again after she’s sobered up, take her home to stay after she got so outta hand at this party"
24165,"I have a feeling this hour will be brutal, what with the holidays coming up. Not fucking selling though"
24166,8 million short volume yesterday. Probably more today. It's been HTB how TF are they still shorting lol
24167,Y’all gonna really let PLTR drop ok you like that after almost climaxing? Buy more shares bitches.
24168,"They have good employees, Trevor Milton is gone which is always a plus"
24169,Right after I fucking sold a $30 Jan covered call on it. Hopefully it’s just a whale with a big order causing a little bit of buying in the wake. Without a catalyst I wouldn’t want this thing to get extended too much. Fine with it staying sub 28. Expecting catalyst in Feb or March after which the fun really begins.
24170,Sold my gme calls at peak and then bought puts on sale. Pls dump
24171,Selling calls on general indices etf leaps has been fantastic for me
24172,I AM SO TIRED OF WAITING FOR TSLA TO DO SOMETHING!
24173,"XL, I think, since it just IPO'd from being P.IC (self censored, not sure if its on ban list still?), a SPAC."
24174,To sell TSLA puts now or 15 min from close. THAT is the question 😩
24175,It’s an interesting play and thought. What’s the downside of IV continues to fall tho?
24176,just type it with a space
24177,i don't think it counts as breaking out if you already own the world lmao
24178,Is prpl actually a good idea or am I crazy still
24179,"To be honest, I was tired of being down -$220 and was just happy for profits. I get that it was dumb, that's why I'm publicly shaming myself 😂"
24180,This EV bubble is just like the tech bubble. You have no name electric companies that are going 10x in months. This is crazy.
24181,All in on XL 🤑🤑🤑
24182,Clearly the market is closed the friday of making it a 3day weekend. Right on the first part but just a snarky useless comment on the 2nd
24183,it's free real estate
24184,"If you'd bought at the start of September peak, you'd still be down 9% right now. Impressively poor performance, to be honest."
24185,Is there a reason this is your only comment/post?  Literally just in here trying to build distrust?  Edit:  is this dude a bot or just some shill?
24186,You would have to find a way to say erection.
24187,What do you think is the optimal timeframe to both buy and sell options?   45 days out seems to be the consensus when selling. Would you go higher or lower than that if 45 isnt an option but 30 and 60 are?
24188,Hey man I had that happen to me. I sent a msg to support and they made it right
24189,"Guess again! It’s just taking it’s time while the market figures it out, all the while being heavily held down by the salty institutions because of the direct listing..."
24190,"The 2nd worst person on reddit is a ""Told you"" so er."
24191,Gonna need news saying PLTR signed a contract to control all the world's data please
24192,"Nvm y’all, u/capt_picard_7 ‘s mom just gave me the spread info, disregard my post"
24193,"wait for it to really crack, there's a ton of downside. Even if were to retrace to the 50DMA it would go down $25 lol"
24194,tomorrows a half day or something right ?
24195,Precisely - nobody ever went broke from taking profits and that was a substantial gain for me
24196,What are you buying and how do you decided when to buy/sell?
24197,Give me a fucking 1dte
24198,Then sell it and play something else
24199,No you’re good.   Good luck
24200,Sir just because they gave you .15 cents for your copy of maden 2012 doesn’t make them a bad business that’s actually a good business
24201,A profit's a profit but what the fuck are you doing taking smol peepee profits like that man?
24202,If PLTR breaks 30 for a day I’ll lick my own asshole
24203,remember elon is releassing FSD beta for christmas... there are some 800 and 900 calls expiring in 3 weeks.
24204,"Alex Karp fucked an underage girl?  That’s the only reasonable explanation, insiders are dumping before news is out"
24205,Not being able to day trade is honestly emasculating. I gotta watch my contracts peak early and hope for a good day tomorrow.
24206,"Told you, why don’t you learn stuff instead of being salty"
24207,Lol why would it moon 50% next week 😂😂
24208,"TSLA. Buy FD. You either lose a little, or stand to make a shit ton.  I have no positions tho"
24209,SPY has been the same price this entire month
24210,It’s about to take off so hard. Just needs a catalyst like...for instance...holiday sales numbers
24211,"Great dip on NET for any of you retards who can hold longer than a couple days. Buy some May $95c and shares, thank me later. 🍻  ...but they’re too expensive. Why don’t you focus more on actually making money instead of losing $40 3x daily on unrealistic contracts."
24212,Not at all lol
24213,"Smol peeper brain, it would seem"
24214,"All in PLTR, have a question though, is a triple top on the monthly chart a thing?"

24222,Anyone got a BEAR page on reddit?
24223,Why does today feel like a Friday?
24224,Girlfriend just got a new job and now makes double what I make.  Gotta find a play here to catch up so I don’t feel like a complete bitch

24231,"It's just PLTR, TSLA, and GME now lol. Where the Bee boys at."
24232,Tomorrow is a half day and Friday is closed. So yeah
24233,Lol ur a year too late
24234,And then pop. That's called a blow off top.
24235,Yea tomorrow it’ll be worth $10. Then you think it’ll go up and it’ll go down to $5 and you’ll try to sell it &amp; no one will buy then it’ll be worth $0
24236,"If I’m buying shares for long term, does it really matter when I buy in? It’s almost impossible to average down with the kind of market we’re experiencing."
24237,Tell me why I shouldn’t just go full margin on ARKK.

24239,AMZN
24240,"probably never, but it's an excellent long hold just in case (cheap enough to hold it and wait and see)"
24241,"Same as any other shit options trade, loss of premium as it drags out flat instead of doing something. Extra con with TSLA is that it is fucking expensive ATM."
24242,$3 swings are for poors.
24243,Well looks like the guy who said if PLTR hits 30 eow he will eat his cats shit won’t be doing it...
24244,Dips are being bought

24249,Made money on all of them except Mara. Check out TH 🐝 R that’s gunna be a big one
24250,Bahahahaha nvm - they banned it because I own SOLO shares.   SOLO is like the least stupid thing in my portfolio.
24251,Shopify call holders in shambles. 🤣🤣  God damn I wish I had more capital. Would’ve thrown a lot more in. Funny because I lost all my money trying to short this.
24252,I have 90c for 01/15 that as of today are fucked lol
24253,"My goal is around 10k every 2 weeks with the capital i got, first trade on NVDA worked fine, the current trade should net me 16k max if good (more successes i get, the further OTM I can go to get the same credit, up until volume is low at the strikes)   I wanted to do it on TSLA but it swings like crazy. NVDA usually is ""safter"" though I know one drop and I'd be fucked if i dont close for a loss or take profits earlier.   What tickers you had in mind?"
24254,Strange spike and volume is spiking also. Someone must have heard a rumour somewhere.
24255,It's a wedge  Edit: or a pennant
24256,How far out are you?
24257,Waiting on a breather on this one. The mgni news propped up the sector without any real purpose.
24258,"I don’t mind losing it, i’m experimenting a trade option, knowledge is good enough payment for me on this trade"
24259,When I first read this comment I thought it made sense
24260,Don't worry. SPY will be down or flat soon. Never fails. POS
24261,Yeah pretty much. It’s just a pure gamble. Tesla is almost never flat
24262,I don’t know a lot about charts but Palantirs daily looks very healthy to me
24263,Wanted to take some profits. I also wanted some cash for splunk calls. And also because I’m a dumb fuck who thought it would dip again before the merger
24264,XL ALL IN
24265,I literally can't
24266,"right now I see no reason not to, i just don't have the money, all buying power gone"
24267,"I'm a bot for mimicking a dumb question? ""Literally just trying to build distrust"". Jesus christ you're deluded as fk."
24268,The beautiful thing about GME is that the more it goes up the more margin my account unlocks which then allows me to yolo into more GME shares
24269,I had an ancient $17 limit sell on GME that executed the other day. I'm so sad
24270,"There is the risk of a large correction, but go for it anyways!"
24271,So basically fuck AMD
24272,"Tomorrow will probably be flat and boring. It's Monday I'd be worried about.   The day after xmas is historically a low-volume day, and it's also a common day for fund managers to rebalance before the end of the year. Rebalancing when there's low retail volume means that dips are less likely to get bought and spikes are less likely to get sold. I don't know which direction it'll go, but odds are decent that Monday is volatile."
24273,Whoa why is GOOG down so much. Wasnt it 1800 just a few days ago?
24274,Been such a boring day
24275,4-D Chess moves.
24276,Up 250%. Probably missed it. Maybe 🤷🏻‍♂️

24281,Update:. POTUS told mcconell he isn't set on vetoing the bill yet but they have to make the changes that potus proposed
24282,I think TSLA IVol still has some ways to go down.  Getting pulled into the big 🌈 boomer volatility arbitrage machine will suck the life out of its IV.  It will trade more like AAPL now.
24283,I’ve thought about the same on APPL and PLTR. Doesn’t he stock price have to move about 40-50% down for margin called?
24284,"Price action on AI is crazy. I have shares, options must be a roller coaster."

24290,"We are in one of the biggest bubble the stock market has ever seen. I and probably most of WSB active members and their grandmothers are making money left and right right now.  That being said, when the correction will hit, newbs who start trading after march 2020 are going to get absolutely annihilated.

24297,Dude. Bask in it.  Who cares spend her monry

24321,i looked away for 2 whole hours and tesla still hasn’t moved

24337,"How do various S&amp;P funds rebalance, surely not daily do they? I can see how that would take big swings out as every time it gets out of line funds will sell it back down to rebalance right?"
24338,"“Buy shares for the long term” is our psychological way of saying “I’m okay with being a bag holder” to protect ourselves from seeing red.

24399,Was like 1850 or so. 3% down on something that hasnt fundamentally changed tho...kinda weird
24400,Wtf it’s up 22% this month alone. Just fucking hold
24401,power hour has got me so god damn wet
24402,I guess that’s bullish as now congress will have to vote to over ride the veto and at same time they can approve the $2000 stimmy

24404,"Yea fair enough. We don’t really have a CC equivalent in the UK but I’ve heard about it. Seems like a good deal compared to some of the prices you end up paying in America.  But I totally get you. Half of my Uni experience I attribute to meeting the people there rather than the content I learnt. I learnt a lot but meeting the people was one of the best parts and if you can’t get that it’s a lot more flaccid of an experience and depending on the field you’re pursuing, getting a degree may not be a requirement.   I just had 0 motivation out of a structured system and so being in education kept me in check until I grew up and learnt to sort my life out.   Good luck to you! You sound like you know what you want"

24411,"The fact IV was so low and that nobody was talking about it was precisely why I got in. WSB has a tendency to love meme stocks but get in a bit late, so that your profit window can be narrow and very scary. SPLK was the smoothest money I've ever made. Its also one of the few times where me taking profit actually made me feel good. I don't care if it keeps going up without me, because I already analyzed my further profit potential and felt getting out now as the best risk vs reward scenario for what I wanted.  I hope it keeps going up so you can fry up some more tendies. We made a good play."

Right now he can sign it as is, veto it and send it back to Congress, which will absolutely be getting on planes back to DC to repass the defense bill (which will be overridden), or he can let it rot on his desk, and pocket veto, because Congress will be out of session on January 3rd essentially killing both the omnibus appropriations and the covid relief.

I couldn't post a lot of good DD because of that rule (FYI, I got in R M G, P I C (XL) at $10)  Also called M A R A when it was $4 in a comment but it was under 1B  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, **congrats to whoever followed my CIIC and THCB posts,** holding warrants back to back will net you over 1500% return without needing risky options."

And I’m sorry to keep hassling you but does the below layout look ok for savings:  *401(k) through my employer’s setup* Maxing out  *Vanguard brokerage account* Weekly withdrawal from my bank account, this is down payment money for a house   *Vanguard Roth IRA Brokerage* This was rolled over from a previous employer. I should set this up for additional automatic withdrawals and just contribute here?  I was thinking a 50/50 target retirement fund &amp; high dividend fund?"
24570,Should've bought puts for the same strike $6 months out. DASH isn't dying til lockdowns are over
24571,I never bought was just wondering if this is a dip to buy or if it’s just a straight up pump and dump
24572,Wouldn’t get otm myself stock looks like its slowing down atm
24573,Double if 0 is still a 0
24574,What just happened with THC-B?!!! Just shot up like 12% in a half hour

24588,I was on that boat a couple weeks ago and I felt like it was the end of the world
24589,I bought in midday at $25.55 - but my gain is limited since I also sold a covered call at the same time. Sold the $25 call Jan 15
24590,Telling y’all right now SQ is on a really nice discount
24591,I was in at 15 and then it ate shit so I set $17 as a reasonable price target since I have little faith in the long term health of the stock and it seemed like the short squeeze probably wasn't all that. Forgot about the limit sell when it started climbing.
24592,"All of congress goes on as if nothings wrong, meanwhile millions of Americans trying to figure out how to tell their kids that Santa ain’t coming this year. Smh."

24617,"Nah leave it alone then, another blackberry"
24618,Who knows when the bottom will fall out of this dumbass stock. I already lost nearly $1K on $152.5p because prems were so high that even when it dipped significantly below I was still red. I have concluded that playing put options requires far more active management than I am willing to do.
24619,"Why january? Because we are in a bubble? I mean i agree with you. Each year we are in a bigger bubble than last year, but market doesnt care. I sat out years of tremendous gains because we were in a bubble."
24620,"Mango man's last present of the year to me - big red dildos on my calls by veto'ing the spending bill.  Hopefully, it results in $2k stimulus checks for the people (and for my other longer dated calls). At least, then, it woudn't have been for naught."

24628,"yo guys, I've never even tried tendies, is it good? Are they available in Canada?"
24629,Haven't you heard? Fundamentals don't matter in this market BB.

24637,"Citron can set price targets and cause a stock to swing anywhere from 15-100% in a day, but when I set a price target it does 10% in the opposite direction. What gives???"

24732,Overbought right now. Wait for a pullback and get in
24733,My calls are for tomorrow
24734,Because I think that this bullrun we got in the last 6 months was caused by the  anticipation of a couple of events.  \- Vaccine News  \- Fed intervention  \- Election news.  \- Second stimuli  \- GA elections.  \- Christmas rally.  All are behind us except GA elections.  That's why  I think we will get a big sell off after the GA election around January 5.

24831,Holy fucking what? 95% ON THE DAY  I was gonna buy this bitch while it was still PIC
24832,"1 to 1, if I recall. I'm basing the 40 price target off of QS's movement, but then again I don't know what QS warrants represent. If they're 0.5 of a stock then we'd see fucking 80 out of these bitches.  Also I bought even more as it rose up so I'm in for 10k for 1708 warrants. I might put even more in if it dips."
24833,"I wish RH allowed you to collapse your stocks that you own, idc to see them if I don’t intend on selling them for a while"

24880,I know what you mean. Looking at goev but the dip isn't even that drastic.
24881,Yeah I put everything I want to hold on a long horizon in vanguard. Robinhood is just my stupid option shit

24900,"stop buying weeklies -- he's going on TV jan 7th and there's a demo on jan 26th  when news of the demo broke I bought 2/19 calls,  i'm doing well on them, and I can keep holding  buy weeklies when you want to bet on something happening today, monthlies when you want to bet on something that is happening in weeks, and leaps when you want to bet on something happening in months  weeklies work when you get a flash dip or something and you can buy the bottom  otherwise you're just fattening theta gang portfolios"
24901,if you have to remind people you're still president there's a problem lol
24902,But XL now or morning? Thinking they’ll be a good gap up into tomorrow
24903,"Just realised I’m a stubborn person, and I also really care about how people think of me. I am so pathetic."
24904,Amzn flat for too long.

24907,"Is there a way to know if that's all what the GME short squeeze has to give, or will it rise five-fold like VW?"

24912,Amzn flat for too long.
24913,"The last 20 minutes of market is about to get crazy.  We had so much low volume all day today - big boys are going to come in and fuck someone's day up.  So far, it looks like might be my day with how much selling pressure it is. Godspeed boys."
24914,Y dude. Wait till they merge and hold. Microvast is a solid company

24919,IN@QW are basically single share 11.50 calls with 5 year expiration  IN@Q is trading at 16.00 and warrants are trading at 3.67  16.00-11.50 = 4.50  Five years of theta for -.83
24920,I am not holding that long. Prolly dump before lock up ends but they do have earnings around march so we'll see. I just did not like taking huge losses is it tanks..
24921,Part of it is if the merge falls through then they’re worthless. Adds a lot more downside risk considering it’s a pricy SPAC
24922,LAZR also didn’t have a $60 price target
24923,"Reminder to say Fuck you to Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and other MMs for fucking with PLTR. honestly they are probably the ones fucking with the bid ask right now"
24924,"Unironically this is like one of the only times I have agreed with Trump  Being the richest nation in the world and offering your dying populace $600 then hoping they're happy with it is hilariously pathetic  A one time payment of $2,000 is pathetic too compared to other first world countries but it's way closer to what the people who got fucked during covid deserve"

24955,Bro short float hasn’t gone down. Short squeeze hasn’t even happened yet

24964,Was there even a play better than XL today?
24965,"Lets see if the fomo on xl will pay off, in at $31"
24966,"You are right - I was wrong. His reasoning for vetoing the military budget was odd, IMO. Social media has nothing to do  with the military budget bill.   I hope that he does not veto the stimmy bill and that $600 get to those who need it asap."
24967,"I mean, most of the day the price action was basically algos-driven.  I'm interested to see what happens EOD today. Especially with tmr being Xmas Eve."

25006,why so?
25007,"Its probably directly related to the success of QS. Microvast is a huge company and actually has a product, whereas QS is all research and has no product yet. If that's the case, then I think the market is pricing in Microvast being much largest than QS."

25038,"Nah his reason for veto'ing the military budget was **DUE** to social media - I know this as a fact.   It's pretty well documented as to why - he's clearly using it as leverage to get what he wants as far as accountability on platforms.  Look up Section 230.

25317,"I just closed all, reopening at next dip. Still happy with today's gains. 14C and 16C for Jan and April"
25318,Why would you sell this thing? People who think they’re geniuses selling today will be in the comments 2 months from now moaning about how they got out at $20
25319,Is it legit or another NKLA?
25320,"Yes, the only thing taking this baby down is a total meltdown. Look at a couple of the latest ipo trends that have traction in the sub. If they loosen up the margin requirements this thing will explode to fucking Mars. We’re not even past the 100%"
25321,Alright AMD let's just go down to 85 so we can moon again. This price action is lame.
25322,"GME getting attacked by shorts, all hands on deck!!! 🚨🚨🚨 Don't sell you retards"
25323,spy calls for tomorrow is a no brainer
25324,Dude we’re still up. Look at the monthly chart
25325,I don’t feel as bad since I made it all back on GME...
25326,Didn't realize NKLA is nearing single digits now. I wondering how many who bought at the top are still holding now.
25327,My hands are made of the finest beskar steel. I am unphased.
25328,I wanna punch myself for buying NVDA at its peak. What a piece of shit it has been for last 3 fucking months. No surprise constant red weeks. Fucking hell.
25329,No it’s not.
25330,what is wrong with retarded MSFT
25331,It’s up like 85% today
25332,Take profit now before all the big boys fuck you overnight.
25333,Feels like it huh
25334,"not enough ppl talking about RM G , real winner"
25335,thanks for being a decent human being though
25336,All my calls for tomorrow are so pinned it’s so frustrating.   X $17c pinned just below 17.  Vale $17c pinned just below 17.   FCX $25c pinned just below 25.   MT $23.5c pinned just below 23.5.
25337,I mean no one knows but I think it will continue to rise it’s literally a gamble. That’s why I go long
25338,Be friends with IWM instead. It dropped with SPY just now but already about to make a new ATH.
25339,Downvoting won’t bring back your tendies
25340,Apple needs a vaccine now to pump plz
25341,Looks like M v I s is done with it's pump and dump. What's the next up and pumper?
25342,I'd assume it doesnt tank because it has a really good base and fundamentals are good (so it's price wasnt based on pre-merger spac hype). But the hype isnt there to make it moon yet. Needs some PR.
25343,AMD?
25344,"So, we're not getting 2k? [https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1341850235077873664](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1341850235077873664)   It's obscene how much power a few boomers have on the world."
25345,You Got 2 Mins To Sell All That And Reverse Yourself.
25346,"I’m going to sit on it over night, maybe roll it out tomorrow"
25347,The clowns are in shambles.  It's me. I'm the clown.
25348,"EV Battery stocks typically run up the next day. Happened with QS, RMG, THC B   You’re missing out on an opportunity"
25349,NIKOLA the short squeeze is coming! did you not see how that truck went downhill amazing technology years ahead of anybody else. gravity technology is incredible
25350,"Mods, can we ban this fucking moron please? We don’t need this kind of political garbage overflowing the sub with trash."
25351,Buy the dip out to 1/08/21 and make hella bux. They will pass stimmy. People are scared because trump vetoed defense bill. We will get checks and stimmy.   BELIEVE IN THE PUMP
25352,"I thought that too, then i look at XL and cry cause I didn’t get on that ride. Avoiding this one too so it’s probably gonna 🚀🚀 always a safe bet to bet against me apparently"
25353,Hedge funds taking all your tendies before Christmas
25354,This is your last chance to buy XL before it skyrockets
25355,Sell GME guys ain't no way its going up more
25356,Suits are shaking BBY hard. Fair value $120 at least if not closer to $150 after the holiday #s come out. Extremely oversold. Extremely manipulated.
25357,There is no gang. Sell now.
25358,So TSLA 1000 by February?
25359,Lol if this shit drops 20% tomorrow I’m going to be so mad
25360,I got cucked by Amzn all day
25361,Get use to it. No one wants to lose money in it yet
25362,&gt;Should I move the money into ARKK or ARKG because I can afford much more shares and make more profit?  That's now how any of this works
25363,Someone who wants a 4 bagger and not a 3
25364,"Look how fucking irrational QS was! XL will do the same, hell even citron is pumping it."
25365,Not how it works.
25366,Short trading weeks often have a dump before the holiday.   That's my theory anyways.
25367,fuck big tech has been like a grief machine for the past few months
25368,this is how it's gonna be now? just every day a shitshow into close? aight
25369,"Why?  It won't matter what happens, our dumbass fucktard pres will find a way to fuck up all the momentum somehow"
25370,Mmm ARKK also dumping
25371,"there you go tsla bleed out to close tight to SnP average like the good little dog you are, no more masa / goldman etc 20% pump dayz for this piece of trash"
25372,Ya. It’s unfortunate because he’s not wrong on a ton of things but his messaging and being such a narcissistic self-serving asshole ruins any chance at actually solving the problems he calls out.
25373,"This is the way. Just sell way the fuck out, because these can go uppies 20% a month easily."
25374,who the fuck is dumping MSFT
25375,Well I’m in the boat with you brother
25376,"Don’t panic boys, there’s so much cash out there it will rebound by the time I’ve finished typing this shitty message. Once a bull always a bull."
25377,"Elon,  Father says to give me a good Christmas.  Yours,  ?..., Bianca"
25378,"Eh i hesitated. Gonna see how tomorrow goes, but I'm kinda feeling like this can run more"
25379,DKNG just can’t hold $54 to save its life
25380,F
25381,"I took no profit On a massive green day, let’s see how this works out for me"
25382,i love AMD and SU BAE 4 EVA  but 6800XT is even harder to find LOL   also my monitori is Gsync
25383,Making THC.B (Microvast) the 3rd most valuable EV stock behind QS would certify that this indeed is a casino
25384,If it relates to the markets like a stimmy or something I think so
25385,THCB... we’re still friends right? Take all the dip u need as long as 30+ EOW
25386,I moved out of AMD at break even and I’m all in on TDOC now.   4/16 200c x5  4/16 220c x5
25387,"Between now and Jan 20 will be among the most volatile times in American history, is my prediction. I am opportunistically looking for short positions myself."
25388,Wait so vetoing a defense bill is bearish?
25389,"All right, all right, quality dump there."
25390,"Thank god, my options can stop bleeding even if just for a moment"
25391,Well it ran for a week straight 1 down day doesn't mean the momentum is done. Great business that has a lot of growing to do. Wonderful customer service.
25392,I can't wait til we have this clown out of the white house and can stop with these flash crashes over his bullshit
25393,Is a spy call for 400 in February a good idea?
25394,Idk what you think but I been holding since it was 18. I like and as a stock
25395,markets took a dump those last 5 minutes.
25396,So buy calls at open?
25397,Fuck it. I'm in. But why CLDR?

25399,Do you already grab these calls? Any advice on filling orders asap when markets open? Should I put it a bid higher than asking close? Would that help? Thanks
25400,"Cloud based company, most other cloud based companies have shot up in past few months with most recent example of $FEYE and $CYBR late last week into this week. $CLDR isn't some pump and dump company. They're legit and have showed consistent growth since their IPO. seeing how they're trading below IPO price and being one of the cheapest yet solid cloud companies out there. I think this has a beautiful concoction to jump up just as much as Fireeye."

25404,You son of a bitch I’m in
25405,"buy, have it go up, then sell"
25406,Goddamn it's such a fucking cool name. Who needs anything else when you've got a sexy name like Quantum Scape. It fucking sounds like the future.
25407,"I grabbed mine today, buying more 1/8s tomorrow. I'm not a fan of putting bids in before open. If CLDR opens up, then contracts are going to jump and it'll be hard to predict what the market price should truly be for some time. Personally, I wait the first 10-15 minutes to let things calm down. A lot of people tend to chase at open and end up overpaying for contracts."
25408,Buy Clou ETF if you are a pussy like me
25409,Yes. That’s not how people do it though. It’s better to sell the contract
25410,Why so soon on calls. Why not farther out?
25411,Above $20 by New Years?!  Goddamn.  What factors are driving this rocket ship?
25412,"buy high, sell low. this is the way."
25413,Negative. You buy a call option with a certain premium cost per contract. The premium goes up when the underlying stock price goes up (alongside other factors that effect the premium). The general gist is: you buy option for low premium and sell option when premium is higher. That’s how you profit.
25414,"Definitely a buy, my two 2/19/21 17.5C’s are already up 411% 😁 hoping this hits $30+ before expiry"
25415,"You don't have to exercise. That would mean you want to keep the 100 shares and yes you'd have to buy the shares at your strike price.  99.9999% of traders here sell the contract back and collect the profit.   Since you're new, I'd recommend doing some research on YouTube. Don't buy or sell options until you fully understand how they function. I got started a year and a half ago and learned a lot of beginner things on the Trading Fraternity channel. Would recommend you check out."
25416,"Agreed, I just bought some today after today's run @ 14.50. Data Analytics/Big Data is the next wave, sparked mass interest by PLTR, and CLDR is well-positioned as well with only $4B cap. Easy 2x in a year. They're not just Hadoop anymore. Full machine learning suite and Spark deployments."
25417,It’s early in my mind.
25418,"I’m trying to stick to a discipline of cashing out when I’m up by 50% but I agree, it doesn’t appear to be losing steam. You don’t think you have a lot at risk with 550 shares?"
25419,Everybody risk tolerance different the fact of the strength it’s shown on red days etc I think this has a lot of room to run.
25420,This fucking doesn’t make sense.

25469,How probable is a dump actually.... Isn't it also possible the shares will just be bought up by institutional investors more or less right away?
25470,You're the reason...
25471,They might also be doing this to protect parts of their IP. In the second article they basically say as much.

25475,Go for it. I rolled all the way out to next Jan at the furthest otm strike
25476,no it won't   ...because it'll reach 100
25477,"Its likely. Engineers like money now and tend not to like having income and equity coming from the same source, so many are likely to liquidate their positions at least in part while stock is high (my target in somewhere in the mid-30s by valentines, with maybe a 40ish ATH if good news comes out). Institutions have consistently been bearish on the stock short term, and I believe its from pricing in the lockup. Wouldn't be surprised if we dropped down to the price targets that have been floated.  Institutionals will probably buy big if we drop down to the low 20s or teens and prop the price back up, but be prepared for legendary paper hands from retail investors losing their shit.  I'll personally be getting out if we see a run up to the tech demo in late January or whatever big ATH we see once we break out past $30 between now and then, then play around elsewhere or hold cash for a bit until lockup and see what I can get on sale. Maybe pick up a few puts to play the dip. After that theres nothing stopping the rocket 🚀"

25491,I consider 85$-95$ to be a good entry level.
25492,Progressive already does this with snapshot app except.  They tried to get me to install it but everyone I talked too said when they tried it their premiums only went up.  Checked what people on the internet said. Same thing.  Plus who loves being tracked 24/7.  Not saying your wrong but playing a bit of devils advocate.

25494,"Bear case it retests $16.7, or if bull case it hits $18.8 resistance you can also enter at the current price or sell cash covered put and take the assignment as an entry. I would take the current price or $18.8 level as I think its about to run up."
25495,You think a root call for 20$ expiring on 3/19/21 will print?
25496,Yea I think a B2B type deal like that would be great. They could also license out their algorithm to already existing insurance companies and pivot to a pure tech company. Then they would have no liabilities and they can just collect premiums.
25497,"Yes but sell before April, that is when their lock-up period ends and insiders can start selling shares. If it does fall during April you can buy back in at a smaller price."

25505,"Hopefully not the same thing happened towards the end of November, shit spiked above $20 premarket on low volume, then closed the day around $16-$17."
25506,"This is the biggest risk I see with Canoo, they need to nail down a manufacturing plan and quickly.   - Short term, contract manufacturing would be good to get them to market quicker without all of the learning curve needed for their own plants.  - Not being able to secure a contract manufacturing deal (due to high demand, not wanting to give up equity, whatever) would throw a spanner in the works short term, but probably be best long term as they wouldn’t be so reliant on an external partner. What’s to stop Magna jacking up the price for Fisker in the future? It would also give them more control of the full process chain.  I don’t buy the point about protecting IP, they already manufacture test vehicles in house and use a contractor. They will probably keep doing that. Once the vehicles are in production, other OEMs will just get a hold of some and take them apart to see how they work."

25508,Some retard warned me about good DD posts earlier. I'm all in.
25509,"Lockups cause dips because of paper handed retards, not necessarily from insiders listing all their equity at rock bottom prices. Engineers paid in part through equity may or may not want to exit, I dont really know. The Software engineers I know like to work somewhere for 2 years then jump ship as soon as their shares are vested. Anyway, generally they arent retards, they know to dollar cost out rather than create a race to the bottom. I was worried about the lockup but as more good news piles in and I talk to whoever I can that has used their products or worked with their code the more I think it is going to be a non-event. Perhaps legendary paper hands creating their own dip then panic buying afterwards due to FOMO as we all support a 30, 35, 40 price."

25511,"PLTR's P/S ratio has LOTS of room to grow in this bull market never ending tech bubble. When I last checked they were ranked 9 in their sector. Look at SNOW. PLTR can be that. Actually they can be better, because they keep announcing new, big contracts damn near twice a week it seems.   Honestly I dont know if this tech bubble will be a traditional bubble historically. I wonder if institutions and retail will just start culling the herd leaving the strongest bulls to prosper."
25512,Well looky heau naw.
25513,They’re trying to find a way to crash the bubble
25514,Who’d have thought GME would be a meme stonk in the age of death to brick n mortar 🤷‍♂️ thx god I guess

25521,This is high quality as fuck man. Really solid work.  The DD firing out of the ship and when the WSB whales came round the corner had me laughing.
25522,Yeah. I have a pretty good idea 😏
25523,That's what made it a perfect meme stock. It's a true underdog story. Plus with the whole Cohen thing there's even a redemption arc
25524,Since you're also a traderepublic user. Do you know German brokers that offer options trading? Besides stocks and ETFs Traderepublic offers only warrants and knockouts.
25525,I am in the process of opening up an account at tasty works. It is an American brokerage with low fees and also available for Europeans. But I never used it so can’t give a recommendation yet.
25526,What are you scared of?
25527,That we got sold a bag haha. It’s a nice chunk for me but nothing I can’t recover from
25528,Interactive brokers could be worth it
25529,"Tracking driver data is nothing unique to Root. In fact it's probably behind the bell curve. Plenty of car insurance companies already use systems to track driving habits, speed, typical driving times and cornering speed. For example, in the UK we have black box insurance where an actual box is fitted and installed on your car and hooked up to the battery. It's not a flimsy mobile app."
25530,"Can I get a fuckin' quant to confirm this shit? So basically it'll mark 13 days tomorrow, so tomorrow or next monday GME is gonna squeeze like crazy? That is the law, right?"
25531,You use trade republic I see you're a man of culture to.

25534,"probably a last ditch bear raid. they'll pump it premarket on low volume, then raid immediately after open to try to break people and make them think theres a sell off. We must hold the line."
25535,How are you holding a bag if its helping for the squeeze?
25536,shit. sounds like I may need to sell it today
25537,Absolutely.. I am buying more if it dips... Fuck the short sellers.
25538,Just hold... we about to see Econ 101 play out with supply and demand curves on a global scale.... that combined with insane pumping from autist while pulls in institutional money - this sector is going to see 2008 stock price levels (maybe even 20-30% higher).  This is the greatest opportunity for average Joe’s to get massive returns
25539,"yeah, that's why it can't be this easy. it would be too obvious.  maybe it could be different failures to deliver and the ones from the first day got already solved. dunno, I'm too dumb"
25540,That’s what I thought too and then I read that post by winnertakesall and I’m getting all conspiratorial haha
25541,I guess you are right. just some financial regulations stuff no one actually cares about. MM can just do whatever the fuck they want
25542,Same. What’s the worst that could happen? It only pops to $50?
25543,"Other posts I have seen recently have posted that shorters still haven't covered, so doesn't taht mean it really is this easy? I think they are fucked with their pants down, and once we see ""journalists"" squealing that GME is trash is when we know they dropped the soap... all I can hope is when that happens all the paper handed morons are too busy stress-wanking to sell their positions...then the rest of us can run a train on these short gay bears."
25544,"Not trying to be negative, just saying to not pay any attention to this because it literally means nothing. When I was looking into months ago, there was some firm that had thousands of instances of naked shorting and having tickers ends up on this list. What did they do? Paid a fine. Nothing happens."

25566,"AI is pure spaghetti code. C3.AI, the company itself, was without a doubt a great idea; I will not deny that at all. However, most people in artificial intelligence don't have the comprehension or knowledge to be able and look at the code-base and identify flaws that could be catastrophic, both in terms of economic, security, and overall functioning in cost signals.  Siebel is smart. However, he's the most retarded smart person in all of AI. He's a fucking child who doesn't own up to his inability to produce a creation and has longevity. Him and his cronies wrote shitty-ass code. It can't scale. The only way it can scale is constant upgrades each time they feel things are getting congested. This is where the problem lies. It is impossible for AI to implement a scaling solution to where it doesn't need upgrades anymore. For AI to work, it will need constant upgrades of AI 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, so on and so forth for an indefinite amount of time - just kicking the can down the road. Off-cloud scaling won't work either because AI’s security is already shit on a stick. Making something more complicated that is already a piece of shit is 100% pointless. People can never steadily develop something on C3.AI’s tech because with each 'scaling upgrade', those who are creating on C3.AI’s platform will have to pivot each time to ensure their product is compatible to work on C3.AI. To sum it up, each time AI decides to upgrade to scale, it just gets worse.  For C3.AI to work to the level needed, the amount of C3..AI in every single brokerage account needs to be known after each transaction. Since AI cannot implement SPV, it's impossible for AI to scale because it does not have the capabilities to know the exact amount of AI stocks in every single brokerage account  after each transaction at a massive scale.  The only way to permanently fix C3.AI’s crappy software would be to roll back the AI to the beginning almost. Siebel is just your average American retard who can't produce anything of value."

25650,You’re on Wall Street bets bro. Citron published an article (short activist) to pump XL and when this sub turns it into a meme stocks it’s off to the MOOOOOON
25651,That was my grandma. I asked her for a gift card for Christmas.
25652,I don't have robinhood but you may need to enter THCBW manually.
25653,Santa seems to be infected with COVID and will turn into a super spreader tomorrow night.
25654,AAPL is ghey
25655,"The more shares you have, the more you make if it goes up though correct? I mean if I have one share of ARKK and it goes up let’s say $10, versus if I had 3 shares and it went up, i’d make much more. If I’m not understanding correctly, tell me where i’m wrong."
25656,Word. I did that for 3 weeks then paid the scalp for a 3080.
25657,"Great time to go theta tomorrow, if you didn't already today. We're looking at a two-and-half day weekend plus a shortened next week."
25658,Lol I still didn’t get in.
25659,Ok imma need me a solid Green Day tomorrow else I’m fucked
25660,Nice put my last $50 into spy 368 puts eod now 350
25661,I'm selling 5% otm. It's in my Roth so if the get called away I'm not triggering a taxable event. 5% in a month is more than plenty for me
25662,Called for amd and nvidia calls since gpus were sold out but it looks like it's a supply issue. Samsung is having trouble producing enough gddr 6 memory. They hopefully will be able fix the supply issue by q4.   No idea how to play this
25663,I just put my life savings on F E Y E calls expiring tomorrow
25664,Yes as it’s always good to get the opinions of other autists since this cesspool is a fraction of the market
25665,"Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Says his high IV weekly stock options are going to expire worthless. Doctor says, 'Treatment is simple. Great autists are posting loss porn on WSB tonight. Go and read them. That should pick you up, make you laugh. ' Man bursts into tears. Says, 'But doctor…I am an Autist.'"
25666,Ope no defense bill? Better sell my AAPL stock
25667,It needs to pick itself up by it's flamboyant bootstraps
25668,What are your positions? Interpret that however you want.
25669,Bro if today wasn’t green for you then wtf are you holding
25670,"I can only imagine how big of a shit market is going to take at open tomorrow. If we even open green, it’s going to fade so fast. Every damn time I get to a good spot for 1 minute this dumb ass market can’t hold gains"
25671,Now I’m just sad before Christmas lmao
25672,"Oh shit, so they’ll hit? I have 2 $9C 4/16"
25673,"Can you explain how it works then? I have many more shares of ARKK and ICLN, when it rises some I make much more profit from having more shares, versus I have a few shares and QQQ goes up some, I make less. I thought that’s the whole point of having more shares is you make much more"
25674,That F aapl dump 😞

25680,why'd apple fall?

25682,5-10% gains every day will make you a millionaire very quickly  i'm fine with playing it smooth from here out. longer dated calls. no fomo. enter positions when it's smart.
25683,I put a 110 into 12/24 368p at the top .55c each
25684,Nice call. How low are you expecting it to fall?
25685,"Linear scale, 1hr chart, trendline bottom of pennant Nov10 and around Nov16 sets up a support that keeps going. Top of pennant trendline at those blow off tops, Nov27 and Dec8. The top and bottom trendlines converge around Dec24."
25686,"Yeah that was me, 18.5p. You went balls in. Well played."
25687,"Dad: “Well kids, looks Iike we’ll be eating that dog I got you for Christmas. I just paper-handed my calls.”  Kids: “We got a dog!?! And what’s paper hands?”"

25692,Where are the people who promised AAPL 140 EOW 😔
25693,Can we make PLUG the next meme stock for the sub and take a break from gamestop and tesla for a while?
25694,I can’t trade options
25695,Yeah but that’s not why the market dropped. I was literally watching it live on TV when it was announced and market was unmoved.
25696,"We’ll see, mine are dated for New Years so we’ll see"
25697,It’s so WSB. Shame most of the tickers are banned.
25698,"Min low 30s on merger hype, like 70 when tsla or gm buys it"
25699,"Did you buy in without know what was going on lol. They will merge with Microvast, once it's announced shit is gonna go bonkers"
25700,Sold today it was a good run what’s the next buy boys ?
25701,"There's not really enough volume on the fail list to make much of a difference.  What you should be looking at is to figure out how much stock is available at $22-$24 and what it will take to push above that level.  Because to me, it looks like right now, there's a *lot*."
25702,It’s been mooning. Made $430 on a $350 investment the last two trading days

25704,"See the problem with this approach is you not having any kind of thesis behind your plays. If you only follow the bandwagon you’ll end up holding the bag. Find a play based on some theory on some underlying fact, stick to it until the fact changes of you want to take profits."
25705,People apparently think the stimulus bill was vetoed. It was the spending bill. Arguable just as or more important but still...
25706,Brother same.  I made bank on AMD going from $85 to $94 and then proceeded to fritter away all the gains and then some.  Now I’m balls deep in GME and so far doing well but I won’t be surprised if I fuck this up as well.
25707,no your phone isnt glitching we had a recession in the last 10 minutes
25708,"Its not wether they agree or not. Its what they can be convinced to beleive. They wouldn't come at you for what your doing, they would paint your actions in a terrible light, and they would never talk about the why."
25709,I tell myself this shit all the time and then get bored
25710,No it’s because Trump vetoed the spending (not stimulus) bill
25711,"AAPL died, SPY died, SQQQ spiked.   Perfect day to go in on Apple leaps expecting a fucking continuation after that dip was bought, and then getting fucked literally the last 10 mins"
25712,What? Dude why would I lie about that. Like the market literally didn’t react from that.
25713,"President Trump refused to sign a spending bill, and he’s likely to get over ruled.  The real winners is anyone with just OTM puts bought today."
25714,LOL I have calls. But that would be a good play for tomorrow.
25715,"VGAC options are available now, you gonna buy?"
25716,AAPL is trash. Fuckkkkkk
25717,I am retarded. I haven't been listening to the randos on Reddit. I will listen to all the randos.
25718,Definitely lookin for quick money so gonna give PLTR a go

25728,😍 you can say it now
25729,"The puts were using my strategy, where I look for bearish divergence and weakness/break down of key levels to find profit taking points on stocks that have gone parabolic and broke out of my upward channels. Unfortunately, every signal was false and every dip was bought up in this market. If timed correctly, these can give you stupid gains on just a 5% sell off.  GME, I was going for quick day trade calls for a continuation play where I bought in after it found support at the 20EMA after the morning sell off and bounced. I was up 30% for a few min then it sold off and never recovered. I was expecting more strength since the market's been so bullish lately, and just couldn't find the right exit. Should've known GME goes parabolic for 2 days and sells off on the 2nd day since that's exactly what happened on the last time it hit 19."
25730,It’s legit. They have products. Look at their 3 month chart. I see a fat bull flag. I think it’s consolidating and will push higher soon.

No point in spending tons of time trying to do a good job if you're beholden to someone who doesn't give a shit.

25738,I didn’t pull the trigger like an idiot
25739,That’s what I said it already mooned. It jumped that much because it went up 11% in a day
25740,"It’s all about the dollar amount that you have in each. If you have $300 of QQQ and $300 of ICLN, and they both increase 2% on a day, your amount gained is the same. Make sense?"
25741,Not really a big deal only up 10% right now I’m pretty sure we are due for a correction and will most likely see it after Christmas
25742,How much? Kiss it goodbye pal
25743,Apple is both a boomer and growth stock.

No experience with VG. Do your thing. Something to think about here though: you will get taxed on the capital gains in this account if you are doing short term investments. If you are setting up longer term positions in this account, it might make more sense to take 401K loan for down payment since it is essentially loaning yourself money from the bank of you at 4.5%. Also some opportunity costs associated with the missed growth from those funds, but with the amounts you are putting in, you’ll be fine)  Roth - I would read tax laws on this to see what would benefit you most.   More importantly, I’d shell out the $250-$350 to meet with a CPA for an hour or two and develop an entire plan to maximize your income. You are currently talking about saving nearly 25% of your income in some relatively stringent investment vehicles you can’t touch until you are in your late 50’s."
25757,Why don't just move to another sub and start over?
25758,Exactly. In the coming days there’s going to be a nice chance to buy the dip when it consolidates. All we need to do is hype it up for a few days
25759,I don’t do options. I buy SPAC shares and if I’m wolf warrants.

25761,Agree what a sip
25762,gme has its own subreddit. lol
25763,It did and then immediately tanked. My guess was bad timing with apple car announcement/new virus strain/Trump dump. I hope it goes back up because I didn’t have time to sell and not sure if I’m going to hold long yet 😬
25764,If the ev hype dies down so does plug and it looks like it might be dying down right now. I’m about to buy some June cyclical stock calls on the next big red day instead of hoping for wsb to hype a stock

There’s also some speculation that Rivian will use plug in their EV as amazon is heavily invested in both companies."

25783,"The structure and social environment were baked into the price of tuition - it feels like a raw deal minus the place to be and people to meet.

I’m loosely pursuing multimedia studies, specifically editing and VFX, things I recon I could DO just fine without a degree, maybe even find a job. If I was motivated enough to do actually work towards it independently everyday.   But since the education (in a narrow sense) is secondary to the environment for me, I think relying on the structure of education to generally DO the thing I’m studying is a bad sign.

25795,What kind of strike/exp would you advocate? And what would happen if you sell a call -- does the strike have to match? and what happens to the leap if the call I sold hits?
25796,yes. yes it is. brutally horrific.

Once he leaves office and his tax records can be subpoenaed and used on court you’re going to learn just how poor he is.

Own a business, pocket all the money and launder it into private offshore accounts, and foundations/charities/and trusts, then claim no income, pay no taxes, get every social benefit, and pay no expenses for running the business in the first place since you claimed bankruptcy.   That 'business credit card' debt you were using to buy office supplies, but also use for personal expenses is all wiped away in the 'bankruptcy'."

The Commercial RE community was stunned anyone would pay that much. It of course ended in massive failure. He’s only had one commercial success in his life which was the original Trump tower, and that’s only because it was built with his daddy’s money, mafia concrete, and unpaid contractors. Look at the facts man. Don’t be in a cult. If the facts support your conclusion then fine, but don’t do it the other way around. It’s a really ignorant way for you to live your life. Trump is a massive failure and is currently living on borrowed russian money. These are facts."

25845,Of course this stonk is a shitshow but I don’t see it fizzle any time soon. Easy buy and count ur $
25846,"But people are not selling,at least WSB is not. I agree at this time it’s all about patience and not everyone has 💎 hand but overall people are holding. Time will tell but I am fairly confident that there will be a big short squeeze."
25847,"Oh, yikes, you cared enough to go into my profile.  I have no fucking clue how old you are, because it's absolutely impossible for me to give less of a fuck."
25848,so no tendies for me?  I'm so sad....
25849,but where tho? I've never heard of them tendies until now....
25850,yeah you cucked...   tho there is always a chance.... Nothing is impossible....  strike under 32?
25851,No...no they aren't lol
25852,I'm thinking CRM calls.  Ain't no way that b staying under 240$ for that long
25853,yeah.... but gonna happen soon I hope. This bad dog can't be held down for that long smh....
25854,I ended up getting some of that too and am pleasantly surprised. Tiny position popping after hours. Are you long on this/any good DD?
25855,The merged and started trading again today it think. I just bought yesterday and lucked into it
25856,Your bias and the losing position makes you glorify and vilify ARKG. Take a loss and move on sir
25857,Wallstreetbets is now Cramerica
25858,I think pltr is safe.  Who the fuck knows about gme.  It's pure meme.
25859,"I'm hoping FRHC is really the magic never-stop-going-up stock I believe it can be and not just a pump-and-dump I bought into at the top. It really feels like I didn't buy in at the top at all, the only thing really scaring me is the P/E ratio"
25860,Nigga this place has been mainstream for ages. Look at the sub count and how many comments we get. Why do you think it sucks so bad?
25861,Fucking you're mom hopefully lol
25862,This kinda sucks. I don't want to try to influence your decision because you don't owe us anything but I really appreciate what you do for wsb
25863,Invest in a random chinese company and go. China has more people therefore stonks go Up.
25864,Damn. I managed to lose money on it. FOMO is a bitch man
25865,Do you have a pt for that?  I've been hearing $40 but I have no idea
25866,"Cars are weak af, diesel trucks are where it’s at"
25867,Giving less of a fuck = not commenting. Pathetic
25868,mind you this is from a few years ago...  Blizzard had a way of creating really great videos. Made the games look like trash in comparison but for late 2000s it was a good game.
25869,"These puts expire between Feb and July, Target is $88.   I'll hold for a little while longer."
25870,"I bought late in the day so, no."
25871,But I can't buy $60 strike yet
25872,Yeah this isn't new or innovative. I have this with State Farm and it actually has reduced my premium a bit. I have a little beacon in my car and the app scores my drives for things like acceleration and cornering.
25873,KFConsole with built in tendie warmer is a game-changer
25874,"Lemme take what's obviously a joke, from southpark, about how 50% + 50% + 50% doesn't make sense and break it down to explain why it doesn't make sense. retard"
25875,You can always do your own DD you know. The commodity market prices are publicly available.
25876,i want to make fun of it but also they are targeting a demo that is literally swayed by mt dew and doritos  calls on yum (the ticker not like a cute way to say i want stale gaming-chicken)
25877,They will come for your kneecaps if it goes down
25878,Only in this bizarre 2020 world would the president vetoing a relif bill be bullish
25879,Haven’t looked into VGAC holding apex till closer to merger.
25880,Here you go son https://imgur.com/a/OD9SCFq/
25881,I was looking at picking up when they were at 2.96. Closed around 3.80 I believe but already with ah and futes they’d probably be burned shirt term. Might pick up 2 week out baba 260s
25882,"Meh.  Thats fine.  Your votebot is awful anyway.  I have several posts on here on the ""top all time"" but somehow can't get any posts on here anymore."
25883,"FSR should get back over $20 eventually but I'm not sure by when. As for Dash, you can't be down that much on it seeing that it's been gradually going down the past few days, right? In this market, I think just sticking to calls is the way to go. If things drop, buy the dip.  When you buy something, you need to have an exit plan both in terms of profit taking and cutting losses. If your plan was to get out if GME dropped under $13 and you did just that, then it is what it is.   As for what to buy, I don't know if there are any hidden dangers in SPACs but they have a floor at $10 and as long as you choose one that has a merger date coming up and buy as close to $10 as possible, it's relatively safe. The goal would be to buy then sell off a portion on runs to lower your average under $10 making it highly improbable for you to lose money."
25884,"Feeling bad for you right now, just got the alibaba news of a probe"
25885,How would you make a 1500% return? Without options. Just holding wouldn't you max make %50?
25886,"MT, VALE, NUE"
25887,"Sorry, I got banned for mentioning the ticker earlier, but it was taken off the lift and I'm apparently unbanned. Didn't even get ban flair, lol.  Anyways, yes. I think it makes a new 52 wk high by EOY."
25888,"Penny stocks. Nothing will make AAPL a 300T company, but a 100M company can become a 10B company."
25889,"Huh, interesting that the most recent action by /u/only1parkjisung was to add /u/positionsorban .. Thank fuck that piece of crap browser extension fizzled out.   Like, no one gives a shit, stop pushing it on the sub's users. Super gay moves all 'round, not sure what we expected."
25890,"Honestly I don't really understand it (not saying it won't succeed).  Insurance is low margin, as a renter I pay like $10 and they are on the hook for $10000. I compared it to my longstanding insurance, it's $2 cheaper...maybe first time customers will be enticed but hardly enough for the average person to switch especially if they have trust or other products through their current provider.  I can already buy and change my insurance online with no personal interaction, only difference is the interface doesn't look just like Robinhood.  Their lack of agents most likely leaves them open to exploitation in claims."
25891,I’m balls deep too but I bought when it was a bit higher but I’m gonna hold to 5 digits or ZERO ⚔️ 🙌🏻
25892,Check out $EVER. I made a killing on LMND but didn't stick around long enough. They were on track to pull a LMND but their CEO died at the end of NOV. Just starting to recover the last couple days.    Hop in now boys before it's too late. I've got strikes between 40 and 70 from January through March. 🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝
25893,"bruh, have you seen him? Like, at all? nothing about him is ""do the right thing"""
25894,"Was sadly on the sidelines today, but this spac just has way too much going for it to fail  Let’s not forget the company they are acquiring paysafe owns neteller and skrill which essentially handles all gambling transactions worldwide"
25895,Bro I’ve got $2500 into MT and VALE. Now we wait til Feb/March. The waiting sucks but we gotta be patient.
25896,All or nothing 😎
25897,Agreed. Trying to maintain capital until then is the key to profiting off of it.
25898,"The flipside is that it can also become a $0 company much faster. This is called ""leverage"" and is a double edged sword. It's the same thing options gives you. Don't play penny stocks unless you really know something the rest of the market doesn't... that is to say, don't play penny stocks.  You can get better leverage with options and be more strategic if you learn how to use them right. I suggest digging around tastytrade on youtube or their website."
25899,"It's all good, I'm still $0.51 to the good for the position. =)"
25900,"Hanging man candlestick on daily with confirmation today, following an uptrend, is a bearish sign if you believe in that stuff.   Full disclosure I have iron condor with call wing at 90 so I benefit if you sell. Solid company overall tho will probably buy leaps when i can afford them and the stock is a little cheaper."
25901,You don’t think it’s priced in?
25902,"Well since this market is irrational at, and since every Ev battery stock has gapped up. QS being a clear example, I see this going up after merger"
25903,Yeah true that. I missed both QS and didn’t see any of the XL stuff earlier today. Do you think the Chinese EV stocks like Nio and Li are fucked or will have another big move to the upside?
25904,That would be great. I have a support at around 346 but I'd be surprised if it cracks 355 in one go.
25905,"I think they’ll have a run up for sure in anticipation for Nio day on Jan.9th (I think it’s that or the 7th). If you see Nio below 44, I’d buy it. Ya know sell the news type of trade."
25906,This is how all DD should be explained from now on.
25907,And it also just got added to Microsoft’s store and Xbox store. Microsoft isn’t going to add a dud company to its store. It would have done tons of its on DD to make sure it was legit.
25908,"Search BFT and Paysafe and read a little. Awesome SPAC, still cheap. Microsoft just added them. It will be $20 by merger."
25909,BFT has $20-$30 potential. Microsoft just added them to their store today but no one seemed to notice.
25910,It’s Q1
25911,"Sweet, been watching it but haven't pulled the trigger."
25912,Wtf you’re like the only mod I see actually doing work here. I hope you know we all see the work and effort you put in and we really appreciate it
25913,Is legal to gang up and purposely trigger a short squeeze?
25914,"This the worst article I've ever read regarding a ticker, especially TSLA.  https://m.benzinga.com/article/18915031?utm_referrer=android-app%3A%2F%2Fcom.robinhood.android%2F&amp;utm_source=android-app%3A%2F%2Fcom.robinhood.android%2F"
25915,"He bought the stock at 115, he doesn't need an exit strategy...  Exit strategies for stocks is 101 to never making mad gains."
25916,Dude stop doing that. That's not how stocks work.  Imagine if I'd sold all my TSLA at 50% gain? I would've lost out on tens of thousands!  You sell stocks when their ability to outperform competition is substantially degraded. Not after they've moved up or down on a chart.  This isn't options.

25964,That is one hell of a yolo
25965,"Fuck fuck, why didn’t I buy the dip after earning. Alway buy the dip!!"
25966,"Mine either. I just started driving through country roads with my son, while introducing him to oldies songs, the songs that played on the radio when I was a child. I sure do miss the 90's sometimes, and wish things were as fun now for my son and other kids as it was for me back in those days. I mean McDonald's had a damned playground and mascots that would show up to birthdays there. I know that the employees got tired of picking up turds from the ball pit, and cleaning throw up from the tunnel, but it could be fixed with some engineering. I used to have an exciting life, a long time ago, but that part of my life is over..."
25967,"Increase your strike price now that you're so deep in the money, idiot. You're throwing gains away by holding on to calls this deep in the money. Notice how you only had a 52% return on this today while if you had reinvested this money into a strike price in the $20s with the same expiration date, you'd have made double that much.  You sound like you're still feeling extremely bullish on GME, so there's no reason not to adjust your contracts accordingly instead of letting them stagnate deep ITM. Or, you could pocket half of that money to lock in gains, and then take the other half and put it in an even further OTM strike and still make the same profit that you would have by holding these 10c contracts, but now you also have a ton of gains locked in.  Also when you get this deep ITM, your liquidity is going to go to shit and you're gonna risk getting fucked by the bid ask spread. You fucking morons need to manage your fucking positions. So many more tendies to be made by actively rolling your shit to new contracts as the share price moves.  tl;dr REEEEEE"
25968,You’re a good dad
25969,"I just don’t see a good rule of 40 with this investment. No hate though, I just don’t see the same growth value as some other stocks"
25970,Ok but imagine if you weren’t poor when you bought these
25971,I’m already in it. On the dip I sold I shit load of 10$ put. But should have added more share. I was being conservative.
25972,"I sit dreaming, wishing I put more down back then but still benefiting from GME’s gain. So I say, cannot complain. NJ!"
25973,"Dems 100% in.  Trump says he wants it.  Seriously doubt he’d go back on something like this, especially since it was a video and not a tweet.  It is literally the GOP in the way right now.  What if he’s doing this so people will look at him more favorably when he tries to perform a coup in a month?"
25974,"Thx for dd, will add ticker and watch, ran up too much to buy in now, will wait for some dip, maybe $28 ish, if there was one thing this year taught me, as hot as any stock can be, it always corrects, rather than try to chase the gain, just play something else and have patience for the ones that you didnt get in at the beginning"
25975,"You're wrong here. The right has been throwing a fit on every platform, especially twitter about how much foreign nations are getting and how little americans are receiving. For once I think both sides are in agreement. It wasnt long ago Trump suggested ditching a complete stimulus deal and just handing out $1200 checks, nobody in the house or the senate wanted that. Trump tends to pay attention to his big name supporters and they wanted the things mentioned above. Honestly, it might work out for everyone in the end (except for foreigners, our future grandchildren who foot the bill, and some of the senate who dont want to pass anything)."
25976,Yeah all those wars he got in during his 4 years. You guys are pathetic.
25977,Im something of a retard myself
25978,Can someone explain what this photo means for me in a simple way
25979,Lol and I’m happy I’m up $100 with FUBO. I’m stressed now.
25980,Bravo  👏 👏 👏   Now go fuck yourself.
25981,"Yo, so I'm trying to get started and I've got a 1,500% return on the year. Cash me outside? (6 foot away)"
25982,"BABA just had a clear reversal in HK trading, looking good tbh"
25983,"Wait, so what does this company actually do right now to generate income? They make one specific Jaguar that isn't out yet?    You're also saying 6/15 calls ranging WELL OTM that currently are at $240 for the $80 Cal and  $530 for the lower call. You've posted this on a day the stock has already gone up 4% and aforementioned calls are up 40-70%. So no, I'd say this aren't dirt cheap but lets move on.  You're recommending calls that expire in June despite the RUMOR being that apple will have a car in out in 4 years. That makes no sense."
25984,"$600 was Mnuchin’s dumbass idea. If king dumb dumb wanted to help he shouldn’t have ignored intelligent people and pushed to help ALL AMERICANS 8 months ago.  Nancy said they’ll sign Thursday, the 🦕 🦖are fighting the $2k"
25985,"Copy that. I think this is still a 2x or 3x play. Don't think it's a 5x from this point. Will probably take a couple years to get that 3x. Agree there are better plays, but this is still a good one in a growth sector."
25986,I won't argue with this at all. Smart to find your own entry.
25987,"Same brother, I’m all in all BABA calls"
25988,I think it's very safe to if you plan on holding them in a portfolio.
25989,“It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop” what she said
25990,"I’m imagining some analyst working late writing this DD from his desk after a meeting today where this guy made some dumb comment about reddit and his VP laughed in his face. “I’ll show them”, he says after putting his entire years salary plus bonus into call options late today.  I’m so in."
25991,"Ah that makes sense, fair enough. If we make it to Jan 1 without the squeeze really popping off though then you gotta yolo this into a higher strike. Think of the tendies."
25992,shorting TSLA this week was literally the most obvious play in the history of plays after it's insane runup to inclusion. That's why I was sure it'd continue to pump.
25993,"But your logic is flawed, I would get better percentage returns if I bought otm calls vs itm calls today. If I bought at 10.00 premiums for a 10c strike and it goes to $50 then I’d make 400% returns vs if I bought 30c for 2.77 and it goes to 50 then I might have 6-700% returns. If I do nothing and hold and it goes up to $50 then I see an extra 6000% in gains"

25999,"I'm a tired dad. I'm all that he has, and he is all that I have. Hope that Corona is contained by the summer or fall, so that we can go to Disney World. I used to take him somewhere once every two weeks that was new and fun, now we just stay home and enjoy being outside. I had to take him out of school the first week of November, because we had to quarantine two times in five weeks, because his pre school had two outbreaks. I decided to quit my construction job for now, and I have been making money ever since from investing, I don't have the balls or the talent to throw options, I know that I wouldn't do any good, and end up with $15 left to yolo."
26000,Well it’s a confusingous line.
26001,"There isn’t a bright side...lol.  My play was Plug. 12/15 sold my 200 call options (up 50k for the year). 12/16 didn’t buy options on the slight dip and decided to to wait one more day (this is where things get bad). 12/17 Plug closes +$1.11 (missed the boat). 12/18 Plug closes +$1.06. That day, I bought 1000 shares of QS at around $60 and end up selling everything at a loss because I wanted to get back into Plug. I bought 200 12/24 exp calls and 100 1/15 exp calls at the peak. Plug slides down and I’m down $20k for the day. 12/21 Plug closes +$0.74 but I sell all my options after being down another $2k because exp was approaching (yes I should’ve at least held the 1/15 exp). Do some more stupid quick trades and lose more that day. Overall my total profits dwindled from $50k to $20k. 12/22 Plug closes +$3.32 and if I just held everything from yesterday, it would been around $80k up....  Every move I made was stupid and I should’ve held.  If I didn’t sell everything on 12/15, my original Plug options would’ve been up $90k more so I would’ve been up $140k total for the year. If I just held my 1000 shares of QS on Friday and not sold those only to lose $20k from buying new Plug options at the peak on 12/18, my QS would be up around $70k and I would’ve been up $120k for the year. If I didn’t sell my Plug options yesterday, I would’ve dump everything this morning and be up $80k for the day and would’ve been up $50k - $20k + $80k = $110k for the year.  So basically I had three scenarios to end up over $100k for the year but instead down to $20k. It’s like god threw me a bone several times but I continued to sell. I know I’m still up for the year (so far) and glad to be but it’s still a sick feeling knowing if I just held in any of those three scenarios....  Sorry for the rant. My head is still spinning...lol"

26006,I’ve been doing options a lot more lately. I’ve got calls on LAZR and it’s growing. Crossing my fingers it gets up there in the next month
26007,"Nah, it’s done. Ma didn’t suck Winnie’s dick"
26008,What do you think they’ll go up too? Considering it’s already at 27.14 a share
26009,"Pring Bottom Fishers Collates the KST (Price momentum) of DOW stocks who's oscillators are signaling winter and the rate of change as the collection of stocks oscillators are catching a bid worthy of support forces the oscillators into spring (we're on the eve of spring) then summer cyclical season changes. Currently this Curling action on PRING BOTTOM FISHERS at mid range signals short term bottom where premium is raw and fully theta decayed out. This is opportunity for picking up individual stocks that have made breakouts but recently back tested and preparing for the next breakout.  Pring Bottom fishers in conjunction with the DOW Pring Diffusion, you get a better picture of season changes and head winds for turbulence (Gamma waves)...  TL;dr - Leaders have far outpaced laggards. These laggards will catch up to leaders forcing volatility that generates overextended moves needed to pay those weekly otm calls...."
26010,It’s ok I’m still crying about my 2022 dis 145c leaps that I averaged down on until March 18... then capitulated to being a bear for a month... or not throwing everything I owned at tsla leaps when it dropped to 350... can’t win everything
26011,"I think this is at least a 2x if you hold through 2021, potentially more if they manage to gain new, large clients. Right now they have the exclusive rights to sell Programmatic Ads for Disney Hulu and Discovery, both are giants in connected TV already. If they manage to land a few more clients like that, this could 3x in 2021 in my opinion."
26012,"Can’t find when these units will be available for trade, I want a bucket of them 🚀🚀🚀"
26013,Why give it to foreign people? It is probably a few billion for that Israeli hit squad that went to Iran and took out that terrorist that has been in hiding for decades. I wonder what company gave the government this information? It has probably been priced in. Been a month or so since the hit.
26014,"Only play with what you can afford to lose. I know it’s tough out there but spend as much time with your child as you can, be the best dad you can be. They’ll always remember the little things"
26015,I feel like such a fucking loser working for a salary and chipping away and watching you guys make half a million dollars
26016,Buy anything that has pulled back 10%+ this week. Weekly calls and let Robinhood sell them an hour before close Thursday
26017,My sad broke retard ass bought $124 in THCB shares and now it’s up %70 for the month.
26018,"&gt;Positions: SHORT EVERYTHING. THIS COMPANY IS A DUMPSTER FIRE.  What are you talking about, everything you list looks like rocket fuel."
26019,"So buy more PLTR??  Kidding, this makes sense. Any tickers you are eyeing in particular? IWM is just the Russell ETF, so you’re betting it will catch up?"
26020,You can’t possibly be serious
26021,320P 1/08/2021  here  Down \~52% now.  Maybe I diamond hand until your 2nd dates??  hrmm you wrote a lot of works so it's probably legit.
26022,Companies that make money aren't worth anything
26023,401ks are the carrots they dangle in front of you in this rat race
26024,Did you forget how retarded most people are? This is an open septic tank in a room full of flies. Calls.

26031,silly autist! Crayons are for kids!
26032,Thanks for the DD man. Appreciate you taking the time. I'm looking for a quick flip of the January 70. Don't mind the haters.
26033,I’m sure we all been there
26034,I missed the PLTR train so I've held back on chasing... I suggested IWM because of the high liquidity options and for its ability to post arbitrary ranges that present extreme discounts to otm contracts...  True story: My banker called me today asking how to close BB calls he accidentally wrote before the Gamma Spike... Strange times we're living in. The blind buying frenzy is not over...

26042,"I am thankful that I can spend everyday with him now. When I worked, I had to wake up at 4:30 every morning and get him and myself ready for the day, feed him breakfast, then drive a hour and 15 minutes to work, and had to drop him off with the babysitter, and most of the time I had to work until 7 at night. We wouldn't get home until 8:30 every night, just to start over the next day. I don't miss that part of my job at all."
26043,GME's debt is not anywhere near zero interest because they took it on when they were in a death spiral. The 2023 notes are 10%.
26044,This sounds like a typical pump and dump comment
26045,"Charge your phone bro, don't let anything go tits up. This is the way."
26046,So sell it. And then reinvest it in something that is dipping THAT IS ALSO STILL A VIABLE COMPANY and then wash rinse and repeat. That $124 is never going to turn into $2000 I’d you just leave it sitting in something that will never reach $2000 a share.   Well...maybe it will in like 15-20 years but that’s boomer shit.
26047,You should check out a few other new threads lol. Apparently there’s indicator of huge inside trading for BB on 7.5c weeklies. Volume seems to back it up. Could pop on news this week.   More importantly not too late on PLTR. I work in tech and this is stock I’m highest on. I started at $18 and will keep buying shares and just put them away. Also have a couple 26c expiring 12/24. Will probably roll 2 and even exercise one  Might regret it next week if it pulls back but I’m confident I won’t in a year because I don’t want to keep avg up. Another guy has been posting weekly DD on PLTR options that have been spot on. He think 40s later next month. Some big catalysts with Karp interview and demo day coming up
26048,Why buy OTM when you are rockin with 150k
26049,Lol like I'm on a scheme with OP? Can't be too careful 😜 guilty until proven innocent is the way in our world
26050,"$600 or $2000, it don’t matter. It’s all going into stonks either fuckin way."
26051,Don’t think I’ll sell when it’s still got some 🚀 potential. It’s also not my only stock but I’m just newer to this because I was too autistic to learn earlier.
26052,"Downvote me all you want guys Trump knows 2K ain’t happening, he is stalling so nothing gets done until the next administration. If you listen to the end of his Twitter video it’s quite clear he’s either delusional or trolling"
26053,"Let’s say Magna wins business and supplies parts to Apple. I’ll be generous and say Magna gets 20% of vehicle content. Qtr glass, mirrors, some modules, some exterior bla bla bla. Let’s further say Apple is amazing and launches 3 platforms simultaneously (pipe dream). This would represent such a small portion of the overall value of magna that you would likely not even see it blip on their GAAP reporting. This is 100% buy the rumor shit. Which you may see a small blip but this ain’t going to the moon, maybe Troy, but not the moon. In my experience these JVs don’t always produce fruit. My advise, try to find a way to get in at Rivian (currently private equity) that’s the name in Detroit you are going to hear a lot more of.   Positions. I work for magna...."
26054,They’re the 3rd largest automotive supplier by sales. I like it. Regardless of the Apple rumors I think it’s reasonably cheap considering it’s potential for growth as it catches up to its EV peers? I don’t think the $40B in revenue is anything to sneeze at
26055,"As always, the real DD is in the comments"
26056,"Did you guys hear the last 30 seconds of his speech. While yes he asked Congress to increase payments to $2k for individuals and $4k for couples, he also asked to get rid of the wasteful items. These wasteful items may cause more delays. So here’s how I see it playing out: Scenario 1: increase to $2k but leave the “wasteful” spending. Trump will not sign and opposition faced by senate republicans.   Scenario 2: increase to $2k and get rid of “wasteful” spending. Trump will sign and senate Republicans May back it but house Democrats will not budge. Scenario 3: leave at $600 and leave the “wasteful” spending. Both senate and house agreed but trump doesn’t want to sign.  Scenario 3 is most likely. I can’t recall off the top of my head but I believe Congress can override the veto with 2/3 majority vote or something like that which I believe they already had to originally push it through."
26057,there should be a rule about posting yolos and not showing allocation or nav.
26058,Thank you for the DD friend
26059,This is a piece of art 👌🏻

26062,I got in early. 5 and 7 dollar strikes all expiring Jan 2022
26063,&gt;Uhhh so what you’re saying is they know how to turn a profit?  Amazon has the marketshare to be able to provide horrible support and do whatever they want.    Wish is a bottom feeder.  A pretty aliexpress.  A pig with lipstick.  Going to make that pig squeal!
26064,"I like KO, T, &amp; BB just out of the money for Friday expiration"
26065,He entered contracts to buy 400000 shares of GME on or before April for $10 a share.  He paid 20k for contracts that are now worth over 400k.

26075,"Ummm, I saw bullet points so it checks out....but what tech play is not overvalued? Stonks only go up. And this doesn’t mention PLTR"
26076,Why would I want to send someone who made me money to prison? 😂😂 even tho he fucked my wife i will be okay with it.
26077,"The gay ass mods have been taking down all the posts talking about riot. I wanted to do a DD about it, but they said no"
26078,"No, I think there will be more upside soon but I don't know that I could hold if my account hit 50-60k. Holding till I get there"
26079,"I was buying BB calls with both hands this morning... Still holding... I knew the price was out of balance and volume has been massive so lucked up before the Gamma Wave... https://imgur.com/a/IvkeAy2  I made 400% on GME from the 14 to the 16th and got caught flipping and instead of buying those $14 calls back at .31 (I sold them at .52, 20 mins prior) but I wanted .29 and they went on up to $1.60 per contract the following 2 days...   13 years of watching charts reel out I can scan setups in about 2 seconds so these momo trades usually develop a lot better after I'm long gone..."
26080,A company like GME doesn’t get lent money anywhere close to 0%.  They would be wise to pay it down
26081,"I sold my 1/15 $20 call the other day for a 300% gain wish i held onto it. Might make another play on a dip, i love this company"
26082,Am I too late to yolo on BB weeklies in the am? Saw most people are buying a week or two out here.   Recently started using ToS. Has some built in scanners I can use but anything you recommend in particular?  Trying to figure out how I should set it up too
26083,"If it's easy, that means it won't be."
26084,Thank you for being brave enough to post a big bear move. It’s not to see something this fine detailed and good play cause money is money and WSB has lost its way with that. All you ever see is 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 shit @GME
26085,damn i thought everyone in this country would buy 1 share of TSLA or a PS5.  With 2k everyone csn buy  3 shares of TSLA or 3 PS5's'.  TSLA and GME to the moon
26086,If BB opens above 7.50 tomorrow don't chase the weeklies. If open down buy the weeklies if opens sideways buy the weeklies 1:45 mins after market open...  If it moon shoots and you miss the boat first grab T just out of the money calls and KO otm weeklies also... Literally can't lose...
26087,"Did anyone own this a couple tickers ago and just watch it languish in the single digits before giving up? No, just me? Cool, cool..."
26088,Im in tomorrow fuck it
26089,"Are they going to buy out of the money calls on their own spac and gamma squeeze their spac to the hundred before they find an acquisition target and then people find out they only set up a spac so that they could have a spac to buy out of the money call options for because they really, actually like buying out of the money call options much more than spacs."

26092,"That doesn't mean she's slut, she's rather gathering valuable market information."
26093,Hey man when you go to sell shares can you let us know so we can immediately buy calls?
26094,"Probably going to sell GOEV some point soon, so be ready"
26095,"Thanks brother! Just checked your post history, looks like I can go back and learn a few things.   We appreciate you sharing the knowledge!"

26097,"For every one guy posting his 6 fig lotto ticket win, there's at least 2 more not that lost it all."
26098,Basically they're hoping for a better credit rating in 2021 to get a better loan and not the shit loan/debt they had.
26099,"He’s been doing the plot of an attempted coup since the moment he lost the election. And honesty destabilized the entire federal govt to do so in the first year he got in.  He told White Nationalists to “Stand Back and Stand By.”  That line about “maybe me” doesn’t shock me at all. He’s an insane wanna-be dictator.  No shit.  But.  At present moment.  The GOP is the only thing stopping 2k.   If they say “Yes, all in.”  *Then* the ball goes back to Trump to sign it.  But until then, the ball is in the GOPs hands.  If they’re in your boat, they could call his bluff and say “Do it, Donnie.”   PS:  I’ve been calling an attempted coup from him and his proud boys.  And like Warren Buffett said, “Buy when there’s blood in the streets.”   So I’m personally pulling everything out Jan 10ish, and just waiting until Inauguration Day.   If his maga crowd goes insane, and there is blood in the streets and soldiers in the White House....  that’s one hell of a dip to buy in to.  Y’all thought March was bad?  If Trump tweets “Now” or “Go” on Jan 19.....   that’s literally all it would take."
26100,Thanks bro! Here's one of my throwback posts that might catch you up on some different stuffies... The links might be dead but my explanations are relevant... https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/55tsnv/compilation_of_links_i_use_for_trading_enjoy
26101,"That's right, gotta think big. I he's fucking ur wife and in return tips you so you could make money effortlessly, you could use those tendies to buy yourself another wife (and hopefully she'd date Alex Karp shortly after). Build your network, that's how wealth is created!"
26102,Ok ok I’ll see what happens tomorrow morning and I’ll sell. But man if this goes to the moon after the acquisition I’ll be salty at you tinklywinter
26103,"Rumors, but it makes some sense since they're paying down debt and took out that shelf offering."
26104,"LOL I am waiting for a pullback before jumping on this one, but looks like it'll never come."
26105,"Not death spiral, but priced amid the depths of Covid as a junk rated company. Optimizing capital structure is still a thing here."
26106,"Trust you should've sold today like I did. I play tchb, PLTR, NGA, qqqj (options), and today only gme options. Look at canoo they spiked and than dropped and when they merged spiked again. You'll always have a chance to make money"
26107,Probably a pullback this week.
26108,If it’s good enough for the lakers
26109,Large near-term debt maturities (especially in low/non FCF generating companies like GME) have a negative effect on equity value that MAY make it prudent to pay off the debt instead of repurchase shares.   But regardless the boomer management is the WOAT.
26110,Clearly she's less interested in long calls and is more of a weeklies woman.
26111,So you’re saying buy calls?
26112,You asking what good delta is might be one of the most retarded comments that I’ve read in a while. Go to tastytrade.com and learn how to sell options. After 6months you will understand the answers to your questions.
26113,Learning what? Peloton is a joke company. Congratz and fuck you
26114,"In general, there's less liquidity because as you get deeper in the money, the Greeks start to make things a little fuckey and it gets to the point where exercising the option can be a more optimal use of capital as opposed to holding on to the option. As more and more people exercise their contracts as you get deeper ITM, there are less people out there looking to trade in the option itself since there are may be more effective ways to utilize their capital for a play on that stock.   There's a lot of variables are dependent on the risk tolerances and strategies of any given trader that effect that calculus. Then there's also a lot of fuckery involving the Greeks that shapes that calculus, which I am not even remotely informed enough to even pretend to be able explain so I won't even try. But basically all that shit just boils down to a supply and demand curve for each option. There's a market for every option no matter the strike, but some of them are just very small.  The bid ask spread gets wide in low liquidity options because once you start to get fewer buyers and sellers, it becomes increasingly likely that there will be a disagreement on the price between the highest bidder and the lowest seller. If you have 10,000 people who own to buy a given option, and 10,000 who want to sell, it's a pretty good bet that you will find at least some people who are willing to sell within a few cents of the price that the highest bidder is willing to buy.  If you have say only 4 people trading a given option, you're way more likely to have a disparity in the highest price that the 2 buyers are willing to pay vs the lowest price the 2 sellers are willing to sell. If buyer 1 and 2 are willing to pay no more than $0.85, and seller 1 and 2 aren't willing to sell for less than $1.50, you end up with it sitting there in a stalemate until some other either changes what price they are willing to go for, or a new trader enters and offers at a better price that someone is willing to accept on the other end."
26115,"The correct move is not ""inverse WSB"" but ""sell WSB whatever crap they're excited to overpay for.""  In this case, $500 Jan'21 puts and $750 Jan'21 calls by the boatloads."
26116,Iv is high but fuck it 10 ATM puts at open
26117,"I bought $T yesterday. And fuck that hurt. I imagine it's a was sale and portfolio rotation. So I'm gonna have to buy more. After the $BB earnings, I sold my shares and allocated the money to options for march 5 dollar strike. I see the vision"
26118,&gt;Y’all thought March was bad? If Trump tweets “Now” or “Go” on Jan 19..... that’s literally all it would take  Lol you're truly retarded if you think trump's tryna start a civil war
26119,"BABA fucked my ass earlier this month.  To clarify, I didn’t like it."
26120,"To be fair, with America as obese as it is.. you never know when a fitness craze is around the New Years Resolutions corner..."
26121,I've only got shares in BABA because who knows when people will wake up and realize the value of this stock  It's Literally Chinese Amazon it should be worth a shit ton I just have no clue when the market will stop undervaluing it.  I feel like Lurkin coffee made everyone a bunch of pussys about investing in what will soon be the largest economy in the world.  All my China Plays have traded fucking side ways at best.  Can't wait for wallstreet to wake up and smell the tendies.
26122,"I love how he was blaming lefties but not talking about how the bill including spending for next year, but also the fact that democrats passed a 3T bill with no pork in it until the republicans screwed it all up and now want to act like heroes. lol"
26123,Markets are done for the week tomorrow right? Or half day on Thursday?
26124,You'll get some exotic over extended moves playing those. Be nimble and flip on upper BB hits early in trading days and buying the weakness into mid days. If you're wanting to be in to hold over night you need to be back in by lunch time. If you miss the lunch entry then wait to the last 7 mins of market hours to make you position. This is usually the time day traders pile up to exit and the rebalancing can trap you like what happened with T...  You make money when you buy. If you buy an asset right you're always whole and only appreciate...
26125,"You forgot scenario 4: Trump changes his mind, says he never even said that, signs bill and takes credit for it."
26126,Use your brain. Low liquidity means low demand. Are you going to have tighter and more competitive offers on a product that’s in demand or a product that is not?
26127,March also lines up with when I expect the market to start cooling off pretty significantly.  But Snow is 1 of the most manipulated stocks in the stock market ever (not including commodities) and buying puts too early is just a recipe for decay
26128,"hey don't feel bad. i sold amzn for $300 because I needed cash for cowboy season tickets. yea that cost me ferrari money. but every mistake we make, makes us a smarter investor."
26129,Fuck it I’m in too🚀🚀🚀
26130,Baba is significantly undervalued. The market is probably fearful cause jack ma just got dicked on by xi so who knows how much influence the ccp has on baba.
26131,"Not Civi War, a coup.  Did you hear his last sentence?  He literally just implied he would be the next administration.  How else do you take that?  He forgot the election already happened and that he lost and that he’s lost several court cases trying to overturn it?  You honestly think he truly assumes he’ll be able to stay if he just locks the White House door?   Seemed like his face lit up a lil before he said it, like he knows the seeds he’s watering..  You’re naive for missing all of the signs and for not taking his street crew seriously.   They’ve been shooting and stabbing people and burning churches at even higher rates since he lost the election.  One tweet from him and they go for it."
26132,I more so do swing trading not to big of a day trader. I'll try that tho because I see what you mean
26133,Dun be retarded THCB DA is coming out soon selling now just mean you will miss the gap up when it is announced.
26134,"It's a bullshit statement cause it's stock options which is from SNOW being so overpriced, op would look smarter if he got rid of that bit."
26135,Are you asking how much influence the cpp has on baba? A lot How many boyfriends your girlfriend has? A lot How many autists there is? A lot
26136,"Well, Republicans legislators might not pass an increased dollar amount. Trump is going to sign the stimulus. Not to be all political, but today’s “veto” was all a smokescreen to create a distraction from the pardons. Once that blows over he’ll sign anything."
26137,"And that’s better long term, cuz if reps fuck it up here, they gonna lose Georgia. If dems have Georgia fucking to the moon"
26138,No fancy graphs or crayons on a piece of paper. I just really like the recent trends in the sector. We saw PLTR double in 2 weeks after they fell post earnings last month. $CYBR jumps 40% last week. Then $FEYE goes from $14 to $22 in 3 business days. Now today $CLDR jumps 14% with no news.
26139,"Have there been other historical cases of unlocking on small floats? The theory is sound and all, but it would be interesting if history truly repeats itself."
26140,"Yeah shouldn’t it only be like a week or two until it’s signed? I was thinking about holding onto this SPAC for a little longer even though this is a nice big peak. There should be an even bigger peak once that DA is all said and done. Thanks for that, the moon boots stay on."
26141,Lose a couple grand on theta and it’ll make sense.
26142,"I bought my first stocks last Friday after reading your post, and I only have a small investment but it’s up 30%. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
26143,Yeah its makes sense to sell on spike but if there’s a upcoming catalyst then you are better off holding.
26144,Ur saying but CLDR cuz the other cloud security stocks mooned? Can we get actual numbers and revenues instead of a monkey see monkey doo speculation play
26145,He also probably bought the contracts at low iv. Won't rolling them with the current high iv make him pay more premiums hence reducing % gains?
26146,I'm currently reading there S-1 and do not see those stock values anywhere.
26147,Such a retarded dd might actually work
26148,It's true their users are too dumb to use ebay
26149,I just hate seeing these knowing how anyone could’ve flipped a few hundred into thousands
26150,Thanks. I will check it out. Might use it to make daily gains to keep me from going red when my other seeds are taking root.
26151,Seems like magna is expected to develop Autonomous tech for a lot of car companies over the next decade (separate from apple) is this going to make a big impact in your opinion?
26152,What dude is gonna trust this chick after her history with relationships? She's just a pump and dump.
26153,Yes and also I may get a BJ from tailor Swift
26154,"I did not understand that second point clearly (\*I know I'm an autist), does that mean 10 days after the 90 day period (10 trading days after Dec 15th) they are free to trade those shares?"
26155,Sell half now.
26156,IIRC he is the largest individual shareholder of AAPL as of 2 months or so ago. Pretty sure that investment itself could fund whatever he needs
26157,I’m going to be honest I’m too lazy to read it what should my puts be along with the strike date
26158,"The best way I have found to play this kind of FOMO is to invest in the sector, especially those that have not had the same runs. For example, the other day when EDIT (and other genomics) was way up, I noticed that BEAM was lagging. Made 15% just on shares that day before selling.   You can consider other names in the ad-tech space that have not run yet like MGNI. My pick is PERI. Even smaller market cap than MGNI, PERI has a 4 year contract with Microsoft and is Cathy’s 2nd largest holding in her Israel ETF. (Disclosure I am holding a few thousand shares)  In general I think the whole ad tech sector is hot. I have been in and out of TTD and MGNI this year. (Taking profits is nice and all, but damn I missed some runs)"
26159,Why not just short it?
26160,"&gt; “I’m definitely open to it,” she said. “I have been basically celibate for two years. I’m not going to sit around and wait.”  Newbie numbers on this sub."
26161,Wow so edgy
26162,"It's simple . . . Empty stockings, at least seven of them in that picture. And for that reason I'm out, Merry Christmas retards."
26163,WE NEED TO STOP HURTING THE RICHERS! your 2 KO calls are not keeping this retard bubble going
26164,"This is a good thing, because GME bonds have junk rating at the moment. So borrowing money is expensive for them even with the low interest rates. I'm also not sure if their 2023 bonds (taken this summer) allow them to take on new debt, so rolling the 2021 bonds over might be a none starter."
26165,Someone explain to me what calls are in simple terms?
26166,How much are you in for?  &amp;#x200B;  And what was your ACB play?
26167,"When you buy a call, the person who sold you the contract agrees to sell you 100 shares of a given stock at a pre decided price(referred as strike price), if you decides to exercise the call contract.  The money that you pay for buying the contract is known as premium. Each contract comes up with an expiration date. So if you don’t exercise your call option( which only makes sense if current stock price&gt; strike price + premium) then the option is said to expired worthless.   Remember, for American style options you don’t have to exercise your call.   You can also close the contract the by selling the call and earning premium. If premium credited when you closed the contract is greater than the premium you paid for to open the contract, you make profit."
26168,ma’s my good gay bud
26169,"Well most people are retarded so this doesn't help your point. It's like people complaining about Jeff Bezos' ""salary"" this year, roll your eyes and move on."
26170,"Dunno, would rather dump all my money into gamestop at ath than sell naked calls on this."
26171,Every time I've bought right at open it has been reverse rockets. I wait at least 20 minutes.
26172,"So in practice if the stock price is greater than strike price by at least one cent, then your broker will automatically exercise the call for you after the market closes on expiration day. Unless you specifically tell them to not exercise the call and let it expire worthless.  If you don’t have enough funds to buy hundred shares then your broker will automatically “close” your position( i.e they will sell your contract) by 3 PM EST."
26173,Care to explain to a retard?
26174,It’s become like an faq at this point
26175,Don’t listen to this guy. Hit the big red button that says buy. YOLO everything you have with little to no research
26176,I did this when it was at 260 and got burnt on that spike to 400.
26177,is 100 shares an example or are they all increments of 100 shares?
26178,"That’s insane, was the last job worth it?? Can you not find something closer? Glad you don’t have to deal with such crap everyday now"
26179,Don't underestimate the power of monkeys
26180,"My accumulation wouldn’t affect the squeeze much, at most could defend a short attack for 5 min"
26181,1 option contract =100 shares.  So if you decides to exercise one call option you will have to 100* strike price.
26182,Din’t read but I’m in when the market opens
26183,This is my life story. I thought Amzn was going to make me 300k on Weeklies
26184,"Wait for the inevitable dip. Probably around lunch or just after. Watch the chart. When you see it level off for a half hour to hour, it’s probably buy time. If it holds above 30, you might want to wait another day to confirm a good entry and uotrend"
26185,LBO.   Besides his net worth is 3x that of GME so he can borrow against his APPL + WFC shares.
26186,Been in with shares and calls since $2. Bought short dated calls last week and I am currently up 4k on my poor ass account. The 2023 LEAPS I bought a bit over a month ago are $12 ITM. Wish I got more 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
26187,"No no, he sold the company for 3 bil... I think his actual cut of the sale was like 700 mil which he put into wfc and aapl he could be worth over a bil now but that’s not for me know. I think he’s closer to 1 bil now but again who knows what he’s planning"
26188,holy shit this is real DD  never bet against post quarantine weight gains and the NYE resolution + beach body fomo panic workouts as summer approaches in 2021  doubling down on my PTON
26189,it's even the same color scheme with pornhub  this is sexier tho
26190,Once enough people realize that GME is actually a good play and hop in it’ll be ok. There’s a bigger spread on my calls than some of the higher strikes but I’ll be able to sell at slightly below the average spread. But we can come back to this in months and I’ll let you know if you were correct
26191,"2k stimi, Biden talking a third check when he gets in..   Yuppies always buy the newest exercise fads, as well as hopefull fatties... and most people are going to want to lose quarantine pounds, and have been slammed with these fuckin commercials on Netflix or Hulu or wherever.   Going to moon so fuckin hard."
26192,"SNOW starts to melt in March, so this DD looks legit."
26193,The CEO has stock options with a $8 strike. The stock currently trades at $340
26194,Imagine living in a day and age where you don't know if paying down debt is a good thing.

26198,So true
26199,Don’t worry any bad news is priced in
26200,What a riot!
26201,Buying high and selling low doesn’t compare at all to buying low and watching it become worthless through expiry
26202,"I sold 30 15c at $19 due to FOMO from missing the Nov 30th spike, and man am I nervous there won't be a reentry point. My aim is for Jan 31st."
26203,GOP Senate just got fucked HARD by the orange  one.  I wonder if trump is aware what a gift to Biden this is?   Probably not.
26204,"I have a 1/15 $25 call and a 2/19 $35 call, I’ve already made a lot off them last week. But think I’ll have even more gains to come?"
26205,"Sometimes it’s that easy tho, first lockup exp 2 weeks ago was free 200%"
26206,Shouldnt it be I'm SOMETHING of an investor myself
26207,Cool. In Canada you can legally change your name for $137. Are you sure of that spelling? don't want to screw this up.
26208,If it makes you feel better I sold the 2022 MVIS 2C back in November for like 250 bucks
26209,I’m at work and can’t watch this. TLDR?
26210,You don’t understand the story. Right now display and mobile advertising is their bigger drivers...and we just came out of a fucking pandemic. Hint: brands tend not to advertise then. CTV is growing like a weed and desktop and mobile will soon reverse.   You got this wrong buddy.
26211,It’s called market autism
26212,I will be messaging you in 1 month on [**2021-01-23 12:27:41 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-01-23%2012:27:41%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/ggsi8ip/?context=3)  [**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fkina26%2Fsnow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put%2Fggsi8ip%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-01-23%2012%3A27%3A41%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.  ^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Delete%20Comment&amp;message=Delete%21%20kina26)  *****  |[^(Info)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&amp;message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&amp;subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)| |-|-|-|-|
26213,That's another problem. The reason they are even going public now is because there are so many different options available. Most of these companies will go bankrupt. Tchb is green premarket. So we will see if it reverse or continues to climb.
26214,Sold half my 1/15 22.5c to secure some profits when it hit $25... Kinda feel sick.   Profit if profit but I still sometimes feel the big sad looking back. Gotta break that habit.
26215,"For Magnite, I was mildly enthusiastic and took a tiny position &lt; 1% from around 19$. Sure, they are/were really tiny and have a lot of room to grow, but is that a good enough argument? Where's the visionary CEO ala Jeff Green behind this? Any market-leading tech? First-mover advantage? Moat? Is just being associated with programmatic advertising enough?  I don't like how fast things are happening. I want to watch such companies for a couple quarters and grow an opinion/conviction worthy of my investment. But if one doesn't jump in at breakneck speed, a lot of perceived opportunity seems lost."
26216,Are they allowed here?
26217,"CLDR has been mooning non-stop, I'm not sure it makes sense to expect it to moon even harder."
26218,Buy High sell Low killed me
26219,"For every GME YOLO, there are 100 of these guys out there."
26220,Glad to see you have good valuation skills considering the JV announcement alone sent this up 30%
26221,Is it still a good time to get riot calls?
26222,Hoping for a dip so I can buy more. FOMO hitting hard
26223,"stay strong, and keep the focus on your son... he will remember it in his adult life.. I know I do"
26224,"Gme a shit play during the pandemic. They were to borderline file for bankruptcy. Lucky holidays came around the corner. Nonetheless, good fucking play. Id cash out the gains once the holidays r over."
26225,How did you get long calls for so cheap? Genuinely curious cuz all I've seen are mostly on the hundreds
26226,Already sold couldn’t let those tendies run off on me
26227,"This is a buy the rumor situation. Tier 1s have little to no price leverage. As soon a one does something the others offer to do it for a dollar less   But you are correct I am not good at this, which is why I am still an engineer working for them instead of a retiree living in Boca"
26228,Does this mean if GME hits $50 before your expiration date you turn $20K into a million plus?
26229,Wonder if I should yolo all my 1600 usd to buy stock. (Can't buy options cuz euro poor)
26230,"Auto industry is high upfront capital cost (example one tool to make a simple plastic part with gage you could be looking at 600k for one part), if they want to grow and make volume they will need public funding"
26231,The poors will buy a Ps5 and xbox now.  Hey their allowed to have fun right?  Screw rent.
26232,I doubt trump is trying to keep Republican friends at this point. They didn't do enough for him
26233,"If you want to incest in a shit ass donk stonk, then yea, sure.   &amp;#x200B;  If you on the other hand want to make money? $PLTR TO THE MOOOOON"
26234,New here.  Isn't delta the main one for making money?  My itm call has a delta of 0.7 compared to otm calls with delta of 0.03.  I don't quite get why selling a high delta option for a low delta option is a good idea.
26235,Why are people pumping cloudera - their tech is shit and already considered legacy. They aren’t winning new customers and have to fight like her to return the ones they have.  I work in enterprise tech sales and the A talent I know left cloudera 6-18 months ago.  I doubt this company exists in 5 years.
26236,There are no words to express how deeply accurate this comment is
26237,He’s a fiduciary... it’s what he does
26238,"Nvm. I wont buy. If I buy, then it crashes. But since I won't buy, it means tendies to you my guys"
26239,"The bill is veto proof. 🥭 has 10 days to sign the bill and if he doesn’t, the Congress can override it because it passed with veto-proof margin"
26240,Ya GME got lucky Christmas happened. So hard to predict that.
26241,Fair enough.  Agreed that I wouldn’t bet money against them.
26242,With a name like TopClassNews is gotta be the best info out there.
26243,He dances almost as well as Trump.
26244,dont disagree but later today - when trump the fuctard finally realizes this is a huge boon to Biden - will change course
26245,Quick look at eTrade shows recent headlines - they upped guidance for next quarter and started a $500M share buyback (which both reverses dilution and shows their confidence in growth).
26246,"Premium is a bit high at the moment. Wouldn't it be better to just get them right before the lockup expiration, buy the 2021/01/08 $300 puts on 12/31 unless you expect it to drop much sooner.  [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNOW/options?strike=300&amp;straddle=false](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNOW/options?strike=300&amp;straddle=false)"
26247,You'll have his kind of money when you're old and wrinkly.
26248,Short term - anything can happen.   Disagree with the longterm perspective because Hadoop is getting eaten alive from both directions: * Apache Spark (https://spark.apache.org/) now a better platform for big data.  * Data warehousing competitors are simply better than they were 5 years ago when CLDR IPO'd (Bigquery $GOOG / Snowflake $SNOW / Redshift $AMZN) * If anything - I'd wait for Databricks IPO and go all-in on that one. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-24/microsoft-backed-databricks-is-said-to-plan-2021-stock-listing
26249,Half of that stack is also in WFC.   Let's not pretend he is some kind of genius investor.
26250,So puts post holidays.
26251,This stock has been a nightmare to own for the past couple years. Finally sold a few months ago following buyout news
26252,Well don't you look silly right now.
26253,300P 1/15/2021 checking in. Made good money on the last lock up expiration but I'm down on this one. People sold all week prior to December 15th but now it's going up. The 2nd lock up should be around January 2nd. I'm expecting a large pull back to the 290s but who knows since March is the big release.
26254,"lets say its the last day and you're ITM, but can't afford to exercise. What are your options if you cant find someone to buy the option?"
26255,"Thx for the link! Is it only me who got the feel that in the end other than suggesting some entry prices, which aren’t that solid since the stock isnt really a technical stock at the moment with the crazy rallies lately, he basically said nothing too meaningful as he just meant the stock could go either way lol. Nonetheless more info is better for decision making, thanks"
26256,Ye i saw when it was +1% but was eating so din’t buy
26257,"This make a lot of sense! Thank you, will watch PERI and others in the sector"
26258,"They’ve got more revenue than Snowflake, Palantir, Mongo, Elastic etc. Most of their customers, which are very large enterprises, are deployed on-prem and will be deploying their new private cloud offering.   However, they’ve also been working on their public cloud offering for years and many of their existing customers are starting to use it. Revenue will rapidly increase PLUS they can now go after smaller customers because they have the right offering for them, and it is now profitable to do so.  They also will be buying back up to $500 million of their own stock come January."
26259,"Trump doesn't want to increase the overall dollar amount of the Stimulus package, he wants to redirect money from foreign aid to citizen disbursements."
26260,"Cloudera is a lot more than just Hadoop. That’s the albatross around it’s neck.  If you look at the Cloud experiences, they’re all Kubernetes and there is ZERO Hadoop there. Hadoop was there for storage and resource management (HDFS / YARN). With object storage in the cloud and Kubernetes, they don’t use Hadoop."
26261,Are you me?!?!?
26262,Call your broker and tell them that you don’t wish to exercise your option.
26263,"This seems like a lot of confidence for a company that most recently grew only 12% year over year.  I know the headline ran with 62% growth and some of the financial sites show that 62% as well. But from their own quarterly press release, that is not the actual growth rate.   Magnite revenue was $61.0 million for Q3 2020, up 62% from Q3 2019 on an as reported basis and up 12% on a pro-forma basis  Third quarter 2020 financial results of Magnite represent the combined performance of Rubicon Project and Telaria, which merged on April 1, 2020. Third quarter 2019 comparative numbers do not include results from Telaria, unless noted as pro-forma.  Telaria was around a $15M/quarter company. So the 62% doesn’t take into account nearly 25% of the combined company total revenue into the comparable. And when you look at the comparable it’s only 12% growth for the combined company.   Further the mobile and desktop grew about 3% YoY. And CTV accounted for $11M and 18% of revenue and grew at 51%. At $11M that should be growing near triple digits to be anywhere near matching the narrative. $11M and 51% are pathetically small numbers for what should be a hypergrowth market. And that CTV growth rate has fallen like a rock every quarter.  The guidance is similarly weak at $75M at top of guide. The Q4 combined comparable is $68.1M, implying 10-11% growth. Q4 is a seasonally larger quarter for both of the Magnite companies. As typical you can expect Q1 guide to show a decline QoQ. And probably continued 10-12% growth.  There are far better companies to invest in this space."
26264,Except now Dems wouldnt vote for it again and just draft an amended bill for 2k
26265,"Sounds like they’re making good money, ok I’ll buy"
26266,Only if you're poor...
26267,Dems don’t have to vote anything. It’s already been voted on.  This is all publicity stunt. Mitch and the GOP will never agree to $2k. Trump has no leverage. They will end up with the original bill
26268,Fuck it I’m in!
26269,Feeling this in X right now. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
26270,Reverse dimitri is fucking golden holy shit well done
26271,"If the bill is vetoed, the Senate votes again. Dems can bring it below the threshold to pass after a veto. The house drafts a new bill and passes it with 2k while all this is happening. Even if it's a pocket veto, the house can pass the new bill and pressure a vote in Senate for it. Bad optics everywhere for Mitch unless he just goes with the 2k now"
26272,Yeah I get that low liquidity equals low demand but I don’t get why there would be any less demand for itm options as apposed to otm options. Seems counter intuitive to me.
26273,Luv u thanks fam

26299,It'll take a market correction for $SNOW to come back down to earth.  Snowflake is one of many companies that are defying economic reality &amp; a lockup isn't going to change that.
26300,Why hasn't Canaan moved?
26301,You need a refesher on how this works .
26302,You're good still. Avg down if you can and sell the double top or ride the extended move into tomorrow's open
26303,"Lo,l, no kidding.  Good thing he can't considering its another country."
26304,"Well looks like it’s a good time to be in! I have positions in PERI, F L N T and CRTO that all did very well today. I didn’t sell anything so hopefully everything stays strong to come!"

26306,"I got some money left, fuck it"

26308,wieso anal? :D
26309,Thanks for the reassurance. I bought into MGNI and PERI LEAPs yesterday kind of on a whim and got spooked seeing them so high right now.
26310,You could’ve waited until he got excited after the reporter tells him it’s going up to 2K
26311,"I’m not sure about the PERI support though. If it can hold above $16 today, I will be impressed. I want to see more from them before I am a buyer. Congrats on the gains!"
26312,&gt; This is all publicity stunt  Holy fuck someone actually intelligent on wsb.  Orange man just wants the popularity from trying to give people more money. He gives zero shits if it actually happens or not. He was not involved in guiding negotations at all until congresses had agreed on the $600 amount then he's out here just trying to be mr empty populism like always.
26313,Noob question incoming. When you sell these are you worried about getting excercised or do you legit have enough to buy 8 million dollars worth of gamestop shares?
26314,Agreed but I think you will have less manipulation as the float significantly grows making it harder to manipulate. At least not to the extent today
26315,"haha you are welcome. seems like all the rocketships are working for GME this week. I am not a bear usually and I like snowflake long term, just this is a short term correction waiting to happen"
26316,"I own PLTR :) and add to it weekly, one of my favorite plays"
26317,It isn't about options based pay vs hard money pay. It is about public perception and the negative sentiment it creates for retail buyers who think a CEO is overpaid on a stock that is arguably the most overvalued today.
26318,It is a good question and I can't recall any similar examples where you had  large lockup with a company that had such a small float while being incredibly overvalued on low volume.
26319,yes but chewy was no where near as over valued as SNOW sits today. apples and oranges comparison. and you never fuck with a company that caters to peoples pets.
26320,you are welcome
26321,I keep saying these stats. I wonder how true they are.
26322,"That is correct, 10 trading days after Dec 15th assuming all of the criteria is met IE still trades above 130% IPO price. It was poorly worded in their s1"
26323,nailed it
26324,"You could, however last lockup you saw a huge run down into lockup. Buy the rumor sell the news"
26325,"This lockup is 3x the size of the first, I am right there with you and agree it will be well under $300"
26326,1/21/22 25c are @ 1.40 rn sooo fuck it buying a few calls
26327,"It was moving higher on massive volume, it was moving higher on small volume with a small float because bid/asks can be manipulated by MMs. That will be harder to do on the next lockup, it will still defy logic even at $250 levels but that is 100 point move south"
26328,Your Mom is a separate person who gets her own.
26329,He's a hardline criminal though.
26330,"I thank you for the confirmation bias and hope we are both correct in our market assumptions. This stock manipulation is nuts but I think if we can keep rolling puts till March, we will make big returns."
26331,the fact that WSB thinks 40k share of GME can move it is pretty funny  amazing diamond hand bro. nice play
26332,stock price itself seems struggling today compared to FEYE. Curious should it be better to sell when already up 25% or good to hold at least until end of year? Other cybersecurity and data stocks are smashing today but for some reason CLDR sits soft.
26333,So not that much different.
26334,"Don't sell before the District Attorney, you will likely miss out and lose more than you will gain day trading it."
26335,If I hold these until expiry and don’t sell then yes I’ll be forced to exercise and pay 10/shares for 40k shares. If I sell before then I don’t have to worry
26336,Another 80k as of right now
26337,Seriously. I’d be doing a lot more theta gang and using the proceeds to load up PLTR.
26338,Where the hell do people get so much money to play with!?
26339,Damn well done sir
26340,Oh yes you are
26341,Cheers. FWIW I sold a portion of my PERI and F L N T shares to lock in some profits but I am still long with the majority of my positions in these two. I think MGNI has just awakened this whole sector and there is still plenty of room to run.
26342,"Yes but she still gets $2000.  Well, if the Republicans don't fuck her, as usual, of course."
26343,has any cannabis stock ever been a good investment? I haven't seen one with decent return.

26346,"Pretty sure that Republicans fucking your mother, and everybody else's mother, isn't a controversial statement. They fuck everybody because they're criminals. This isn't news."
26347,The more the merrier. Let’s all get rich together
26348,Nice. I went with some long bets at 20. The thing is; they are not really printing (mining) yet. That shit is going to ramp next year.
26349,Nah it's holding rn. Doesn't matter when you get in tho. Only going up from here.

26355,&gt; Pretty sure it's both parties that sold us out for decades  Of course you think that. That's been the Fox/Russian psyops narrative for years. Obedient cynicism. Much easier to manipulate cynics.
26356,"Bill Clinton and George Bush both ran pro-NAFTA. Clinton worked to get China into the WTO. Dubya and Obama continued this. It's bipartisan and if you disagree, then you're a retard."
26357,"&gt; Bill Clinton and George Bush both ran pro-NAFTA.  So? They also support puppies. So what. It was a Republican initiative and wasn't a bad idea overall.  &gt; Clinton worked to get China into the WTO.   No, that's not how the WORLD trade organization works.  You don't seem to know anything. How's the Fox/Facebook feed doing?"
26358,"lol  I had TSLA 800C 12/24, 8 contracts at 994 last week, good until last Friday noonish, when everything just went south.... was holding and hoping for a turnaround.  Ended up selling this morning at $7"
26359,"You're not fully on board with the Bernie Bro way of thinking, and you're not neoliberal. I would have to guess you have no real thought out worldview other than ""Republican Party Bad"" and ""Fox News Bad"".   NAFTA and China in the WTO were great for stock market investors, but bad for ordinary Americans. China in the WTO will probably prove to have been the biggest foreign policy blunder in US history. It's more than just about economics. China's evil and they seek to dominate the whole world, which includes us! China's so bad that the Democratic party's lunatic (Sanders) was, like Trump, more acceptable than the other candidates in his own party. This is how bad things have gotten."
26360,I know tchb spiked out of nowhere. I couldn't have predicted that. I sold tchb yesterday and my NGA position today. If you kept your tchb I suggest selling half or all of it. Maybe TMR they will finally announce the official merger with microvast
26361,It now landed on the moon
26362,"Bought a couple BB 7.5c 12/24 and 12/31 on the cheap this AM (I know I’m retarded). You think the pump could still happen?  The speculation was that news might drop but only thing I saw today was that they were named a great place to work lol  Not asking for a crystal ball, just your opinion"
26363,Your guess is as good as mine. Riot didnt have a great day either
26364,"It ran up 400% in 12 days, a 15-20% pullback is healthy"
26365,Now is good. IV is high though
26366,I held out for hope lol I will be selling half and pumping in more on the next dip.  And do you have info on tmr being a possibility for the merger agreement? If not it might still be a week or so imo. But I also have no info to back my claim.  This retard stock is hitting $20 out of nowhere
26367,"two parties, one club. they all suck man. this sub should be about money, not politics. you're a chump if you think either party is better than the other."
26368,"To be fair there is a whole lot of weird stuff in that 5,000 page long bill that's unrelated to stimulus checks for US people. Like why the heck is Cambodia, Burma and Egypt all receiving millions and millions of dollars?"
26369,"Because it included funds for typical spending in the year of 2021.... all of which is pretty much the same and has been known, and funded by the trump administration previously, like many other administrations have done before.   Maintaining US power has to do with using both soft and hard power. You can’t expect us to maintain global peace and not help our allies and being countries to our side, if we don’t do these things China and Russia will fill the gap."
26370,"Sounds good, just waiting for that pull back and consolidation to buy in for a bigger jump"
26371,"&gt;  I would have to guess you have no real thought out worldview other than ""Republican Party Bad"" and ""Fox News Bad"".  If I didn't that would be a very accurate and righteous (and true) worldview. Really couldn't go far wrong starting from that. But not ""bad"" try ""truly evil, along with their followers.""  China is bad, for sure -- but why do you think you've been programmed to repeat this. Hint: take your eye off the ball."
26372,"It looks like the 2 o'clock close tomorrow is going to get them if they don't get a pump. Time and volume is on our side, but the B B plague is a real head scratcher.

Got a glimpse of what that is going to look like on that previous spike, but retail bought the dip so heavy that the 3rd party capturing RobinHoods order flow is quashing/absorbing with high volume inside book swaps to prevent the big pay out. Calls outnumber puts 4x at this point and the whales that these MMs are jockeying for are slow playing the hell out of this.

26373,Yea I didn’t put much in so was going to let it ride but was thinking about avg down on the 12/31 since it’s dirt cheap. Will be interesting to see how tomorrow plays out
26374,Well I got a couple. If I make money off it because of your dd. Il buy ya a gold sir
26375,"Yes, and I'm a genius here in WSB. That's why I hang around you guys -- to make me look good.  I mean, you literally had to process in your brain remnant that I, who goes by the name of ""StockDealer"" is not a Bernie bro.  But even I am not stupid enough to fall for the Republican shit like ""hey, shiny China! Ignore the whole Russian attack and traitor!"""
26376,"I wonder what's keeping them from just making separate bills then, one strictly for US spending and a different one for foreign spending."
26377,No but tbh it makes more sense for the spike because of xl fleet right now. Hence why NGA spiked as well. Selling half is a good decision. I do that when Im not sure if it will carry forward. Now I'm eyeing crsr or more PLTR shares if there is end to a dip next week for NGA and tchb
26378,"That’s the way republicans and the owners of this company have structured things. Throw secret shit into a bill and if they don’t approve it, refuse to work until it gets approved. Why do you think there was voter fraud to keep Mitch McConnell in power?"

26380,"Jeeesh. I couldn't imagine being that naïve. Best of luck with reality, buddy"
26381,Is the a troll comment? If you buy 30c instead of 10c then you can buy significantly more contracts with the same amount of money. 100 contracts worth $1 each is worth more than 10 contracts worth $5 each.  How are we seriously having a conversation about whether or not a higher percent return is a good thing
26382,"What? You are comparing apples to oranges. Why are you using two different initial investment amounts? Higher percentage always means higher returns with the same amount of money invested, what the actual fuck, retard. Do I seriously have to explain how 100% is larger than 50%?  They day before he took this screenshot, he had $269,000. Nice. He then saw a 50% return on that money the next day, bringing him to $409,000.  If he had taken that $269,000 and reinvested it into 25c 4/15/2021, he would have made a 100% return the next day, leaving him with $538,000,  Which number is bigger: $409,000, or $538,000?  This sub might be completely fucking hopeless lmao"
26383,"No you’re right, but I have less risk in my current position. Also still not going to sell due to tax reasons, will re-evaluate in a couple of weeks"
26384,"No, retard. The guy I'm replying to was comparing 6,000% on $20k to 600% on $400k, which is apples to oranges. I am comparing two different percentage returns on the same investment amount, which is not apples to oranges.   I am legit impressed how many people on this sub seem to lack such basic reading comprehension and arithmetic skills that I honestly don't know if they passed the 6th grade."
26385,Got in on this one. Thanks for the solid DD. scooped some 1/15 310P for $12
26386,"Because the value of a deep ITM call increases more slowly when the price of the underlying stock goes up. If someone is bullish on a stock, it simply makes more sense to purchase an option that they expect to increase in value faster for every dollar the underlying share price goes up. Now, buying deep ITM options can be lower risk and you won't get murdered as fast as when the share price falls, which is why there's a market for those strikes at all. Some people decide that the lower risk is worth the slower gains. But the percentage of people deeming the reduced speed of gains to be worth it gets smaller and smaller as that speed slows down the deeper ITM you go.  The slower returns are because the premiums are more bloated relative to the probability of profit than the higher strikes. This is where all the Greeks come in and it's a lot more complicated than this, but since I am too retarded to accurately get into that: the extremely simplified explanation is that less sellers are willing to write a brand new, deep ITM contract (because why would you sell contracts that are almost guaranteed to be exercised on you), which makes the premiums bloated due to reduced supply. Usually, most deep ITM contracts traded are ones that previously existed and moved hands rather than ones that are written fresh for a new buyer, from what I understand."
26387,"I'm here to laugh at the tards here, and you fit right in with them. You call the Republicans ""truly evil, along with their followers"" but simply label China as ""bad"". This is why I say your flair is accurate. Trump is too lazy to be the threat you seem to think he is. Sure Trump's a psychopath, and sure Bernie Sanders is a life long Communist sympathizer and an even more dangerous person than Trump is (mostly because he actually has an ideology), and you can say a lot of bad things about a lot of the other fringe people. But they are better than this corrupt status quo. And to label their *supporters* as ""truly evil"" is just something a person who is a dumb kid, a dumb cultist, or both would say.   Russia and China are both threats. China's rise is an existential threat to the world order that is led by Western Democracies. You really are a retard."
26388,"Not really. You *can*, but it doesn't have anything to do with my point to the OP. No one was taking about getting different percent returns with different amounts of money. The discussion was about the percentage returned on the same amount invested."
26389,"&gt; And to label their supporters as ""truly evil"" is just something a person who is a dumb kid, a dumb cultist, or both would say.  What can they be other than racist and therefore evil? Or indifferent to truth? They just make shit up like ""oh, they're all bad and Bernie is a communist."" They're so pickled that they became outright evil.  Do explain how this works."
26390,"If you don't see racism in the ""woke"" left, which Biden doesn't represent but which he is beholden to, then you aren't looking at the world with a critical mind. There's more racism on the other side. And ultimately I do not care about it. There is something much more troubling going on right now. You're too busy hating the Republicans to even acknowledge that we have this common enemy that really is evil, that really wants to dominate us, and that really has been winning for years.  There are Trumptards, and there are anti-Trumptards. You're in the anti-Trumptard camp. Time to wake up and look at the world for what it is."
26391,"&gt; If you don't see racism in the ""woke"" left  Exactly what I warned you about but you're so brainwashed that you aren't getting this. You want shit values? Then when your kid comes to you just say ""well other people did it too.""  Shit values. Shit party. Shit people.  https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/indiscreet-charm-of-russian-cynic/"

26394,Maxr will keep climbing that's a nice one
26395,"Two wrongs don't make a right. The ""woke"" left is actually pretty dangerous. The Trump base is mostly dumb and harmless. As long as they don't get too carried away with this stolen election thing angle, which is nothing we haven't seen from the other side in recent years, we'll be fine with them. And again, you're missing everything. Our enemy is the Communist Party of China, not each other. The Communist Party of China is the reason why I'm not only willing to vote for Donald Trump in a presidential election, it's why I'd vote for Bernie Sanders over a generic Republican. Sanders might be a more decent person, but his ideology is more cancerous than Trump's (whose ideology is, shall we say, ""fluid""). I'd vote for either of them over, say, a Jeb Bush or a Joe Biden.   China's Communist Party saw this coming. They knew we'd be doing some ""drastic"" things and voting for some unthinkable candidates once it got to a point where the public caught on. They calculated that by the time we caught on it'd be too late. They may be right, but I'm going to support the wacky person in every election until I believe it really is too late.   You have a lot of learning to do."

26399,"Aww why did you delete your comment REEEEEEEing at me and calling me an absolute fucking moron? I was hoping you would leave it up so others could laugh at you with me.  I don't think I've ever seen someone be so obnoxiously arrogant about how wrong someone else was, while actually being the one who is incorrect. It was top tier content, wish I'd saved it. My favorite part was the part where you said I lack basic reading comprehension and arithmetic skills, but really you were the one who misread everything I said and couldn't do basic math. That part was fun."
26400,34* I’m holding and probably exercising a couple. F the weak paper hands.
26401,"Could you please explain, if you are betting on this event, why not buy these options later? I understand that you have gained nicely, but do you expect downward movement not related to the whole market? I mean, if we were generally in uptrend, it would be possible (due to retard strength) that rally would continue. So if you general outlook about market is like that, or just SNOW? Same question about the May contract. You entered nicely, and I just got my contract today, 300p for 20.00 for Feb. Should I have looked for a better entry? I am kinda new and getting feels for option's premium changes due to greeks.     Also, will you hold now, or see and re-enter?"

26403,"I deleted that, because I hadn't seen that you are the same guy that advised op to buy new options and apparently are too stupid to understand that I wasn't even replying to your initial comment. Read the new comment I made and you might understand how stupid your reply was.    I also still stand by my statement that you are the one who lacks basic reading skills and come across incredibly arrogant."

26411,“It’s the same thing!”
26412,"$CLDR announced today that they are doing $500 million in stock buybacks starting with buying back Intel's entire stake in them at a 66% discount. Every share they buy back is being retired. I do think $CLDR is going up personally and made a post about it here as well. Since they are retiring every share they buy back, increased price is almost a guarantee imo. The next 3 days are probably the last chances to get options for pennies."
26413,"Yup. And they started it today. Starting with buying back Intel's entire stake for 320 million. They are retiring every since one of those shares so they are completely gone now. Still 180 million left to do. Literally greater than 10% of their market cap's shares they are burning. This should go to 17.5 at a minimum. If the market notices, I expect 20+ and I believe they are going to."

26418,"Funds and large investors can buy a lot of calls, this then requires the MMs to buy shares to hedge. If the vol and float is low this sharing buying causes the price to rise, called a gamma squeeze. Also look at the order book they can have small bids on the buy side because there just isn’t much volume or shares available causing it to go higher"
26419,You’re welcome!
26420,ORCL is a solid cloud play as well.  Agree with CLDR
26421,"I have the feb puts because I’m playing the Jan second lockup expiration but giving it a bit more time in case it doesn’t go as planned. Same with the may puts after the March expiration, you could definitely go shorter time, cost less money and have more upside but I never have any luck trying to time options. Just my personal preference. The downward trend I expect as people cash out of their shares, not much volume and it’s being propped up by market makers. So if there aren’t enough buyers as shares flood the market because people want to cash out, the stock will go down regardless of the market. Especially with a very small float today. Now as the stock price goes lower, new buyers will enter the stock so it will absorb some of the outflows. We will see what happens over the next few weeks, it’s a very irrational market so anything is possible.  Still think snowflake is a great buy long term when it comes back to a normal valuation. I would think a prime buyout candidate from Amazon"
26422,"But how is delta hedging manipulation? If anything it hurts the MM, doesn’t it by increasing the price?"
26423,"It benefits the call buyer. Let’s say I buy a few million dollars worth of calls, MMs hedge by buying shares. Since it is very low volume and low float, the stock can move up very quickly as these shares are bought. This is manipulating the stock price higher, especially when you look at the order book. That’s how many people want to buy a certain number of shares at each bid/ask. If it’s thinly traded the bid/ask spread can be wide or they will put in a 1 share order at 5 cents above then 10 share order at 10 cents above and so forth. Obviously all of the above goes away when there is a lot of volume and trading but just not currently the case with snow. Maybe influence is a better word than manipulate but same same"
