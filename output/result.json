            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\""

Pretty much as long you downloaded the app and signed up you got 20-30k. People started gaming the system by making multiple accounts and racking up 100k USD in debts with no way to pay it off. Then the cracks started to show when people started YOLOing this money into the stock market and losing it. Then the Chinese government had to step in and stop it.

My options plays on the other hand have been.....less than succesful lmao. But I at least know when to cut my losses (got giga fucked on BABA yesterday though that was a good lesson). I'm definetly a compulsive spender at heart though so I figure if I wasn't putting that money in the market it would be going towards some other BS. If nothing else, the market is great savings motivator for me.",

            "Been messing with the market off an on since 2002.  My brother basically probably had some sort of a mental problem and he went full on degenerate and borrowed money on his credit cards to fund his trading accounts.... it didn't work out shocker... he actually had a good credit score too and was able to screw the banks for a good 100k plus.  So be careful with trading many people get too consumed and can go down a very dark path.  Got myself into a flipping business back in 2013 and that has made me more money than I ever though possible.  It also wasn't very time consuming so I got back into day trading in Oct 2018.   Broke even 2018 and small profit for 2019 but 2020 I am up over 200k now for the year.  Might not sound like much compared to sir jack me off but it isn't chump change.  And it also a gain not a loss which is the more typical result of day trading.  I am no expert on day trading but I have found stock selection is key to making money and trading when the odds are in your favor for your strategy. I focus on momentum and if I pick the wrong stocks I get chewed up.  Did that on Monday and Tuesday in tsla giving back over 20k to tsla after making 30k on Friday.  Luckily stopped fucking with tsla yesterday and traded baba on the news move for a 14k gain.  So now I'm only 10k off my ath for profits this year.",

John then comes across Marcus\u2019 lifeless body and decides he\u2019ll fight Viggo in hand to hand combat for Marcus\u2019 sake? Idk there was some weird honor thing going on. Cool part is that John took the knife to his chest as a guaranteed win + narrative insight on how he sees himself toward the end of the movie (probably inspired by the convo he and Viggo have about them both being \u201ccursed\u201d).

Finally... the reason the movie exists: the combat. Martial arts looked good, however the actual positioning is not. At one point we see John wrestle a random goon for a whole minute without knowing how many other goons are in his house. No reason why he couldn\u2019t have gotten domed during that minute by the dude who had to pee before entering. Same with the church scene. Walks in. Shoots pope guy.

I would never consider yoloing my life savings into an FD or anything like that.

My options plays on the other hand have been.....less than succesful lmao. But I at least know when to cut my losses (got giga fucked on BABA yesterday though that was a good lesson). I'm definetly a compulsive spender at heart though so I figure if I wasn't putting that money in the market it would be going towards some other BS.

            "Been messing with the market off an on since 2002.  My brother basically probably had some sort of a mental problem and he went full on degenerate and borrowed money on his credit cards to fund his trading accounts.... it didn't work out shocker... he actually had a good credit score too and was able to screw the banks for a good 100k plus.  So be careful with trading many people get too consumed and can go down a very dark path.  Got myself into a flipping business back in 2013 and that has made me more money than I ever though possible.  It also wasn't very time consuming so I got back into day trading in Oct 2018.   Broke even 2018 and small profit for 2019 but 2020 I am up over 200k now for the year.  Might not sound like much compared to sir jack me off but it isn't chump change.  And it also a gain not a loss which is the more typical result of day trading.  I am no expert on day trading but I have found stock selection is key to making money and trading when the odds are in your favor for your strategy. I focus on momentum and if I pick the wrong stocks I get chewed up.  Did that on Monday and Tuesday in tsla giving back over 20k to tsla after making 30k on Friday.  Luckily stopped fucking with tsla yesterday and traded baba on the news move for a 14k gain.  So now I'm only 10k off my ath for profits this year.",

Relationship between John and Marcus is cookie cutter \u201cguys who act like friends cuz they both had dangerous jobs and worked together but anything can happen in this crazy world so they keep in touch. Also one wants to live a normal life and the other respects his wishes because.. cuz.\u201d Marcus pretty much signed up to die by taking the contract with the intent of keeping John alive through various assassination attempts.. for reasons we\u2019ll never know (they don\u2019t tell us how close they are). John then comes across Marcus\u2019 lifeless body and decides he\u2019ll fight Viggo in hand to hand combat for Marcus\u2019 sake? Idk there was some weird honor thing going on. Cool part is that John took the knife to his chest as a guaranteed win + narrative insight on how he sees himself toward the end of the movie (probably inspired by the convo he and Viggo have about them both being \u201ccursed\u201d). Well anyway the kid he\u2019s tracking down is useless with no development. 90% of the other characters are \u201chey harry\u201d \u201chi john\u201d hey jimmy\u201d \u201chey john\u201d like bahaha he\u2019s an assassin with relationships comparable to a normal fella.

MCU Black Widow knockoff gets fucked by bar guy for breaking rules in the bar that John breaks as well but John is friends with him too or whatever so it\u2019s cool lol. Finally... the reason the movie exists: the combat. Martial arts looked good, however the actual positioning is not. At one point we see John wrestle a random goon for a whole minute without knowing how many other goons are in his house. No reason why he couldn\u2019t have gotten domed during that minute by the dude who had to pee before entering. Same with the church scene. Walks in. Shoots pope guy. Aims up at one guy on upper deck. Proceeds to drag pope fella. Same thing applies here. John either has thermal vision or plot armor. The supposed Baba Yaga just has good luck.

I sold and decided to just spend the money on something else.  In 2015 I switched jobs and had about 10k in an ira. Put it mostly in amzn, and appl. Each year I made about 20% but kept withdrawing my gains.  In January of this year I got laid off. Still had about 12k from my previous IRA so I did a 60 day rollover in February and bought puts on the market. Realized about 25k in profit and put the money I used (10k) back in my ira. Been unemployed about 11 months and had to use that 25k.  Added about 58k from my former 401k to my ira making my total ira around 70k. Withdrew an additional 6k to help me get by. Didnt have any money in the market after the March crash until recently as I didnt want to risk losing anything while unemployed.  Started working in December and have had my money in the market for the past month. Back up to 70k. I mostly track a top performing fund, TFOIX.",

When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

            "My story goes like this:     1.  Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.

            "36 y/o teacher looking to get rich since I\u2019ve plateaued income-wise. I started in early 2018 when I saw you motherfuckers talking about yachts. When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

I always thought market is pump and dump scheme that's why I was avoiding to invest in it.  I work at the hospitality. I invested 5k into VAC  it's my first investment. I got 2k gain from VAC. I was into value stocks that time due to their prices were too low and even if I hold them longer I knew that it was gonna bring gains. Investing into vocation stock during the global pandemic yeah that's me :P. Then I started to swing trade. I did my first option trade with AAL during June. I bought it first day when they announced that next month which is July they will open more flights. I went all in to July 18C. I made 9k to 26k next morning. Did I sell? Hell no because I wanted 30k and I wanted to hold 2 more weeks.(Yeah all account in weeklies invested to airlines during global pandemic) My account went back to 9k within 2-3 days. I was in panic then bought Expedia weekly calls account went to 4k. Then AXP 2 weeks out calls account down %85. Lost all the savings total of 13k...  I wish I knew more about options and market. Options trading approval shouldn't be that easy.  Now I'm doing call leaps a year or 6-7 months out also doing some theta gang and studying more on complex options strategies. Also studying what to buy during crashes to make more gain. I don't do yolo or weekly naked calls anymore. I'm still down a lot. My parents don't know that I lost this much amount of money. Well it's nothing for wall street but I make 30-35k a year so its something to me. Anyway I'm gonna be 27 years old next week. It's been a hell of a year. I know so many of us lost too much money this year and some us who are more experienced made a bank.  Well life goes on. Study more and buy the dip when everyone in fear.  *Sorry for my grammar.

I am also taking a conservative approach, hence my base price target is at less than 1/2 the market cap from the previous cycle. Until Cohen actually takes over (if he does) and the new direction for the company is made clear, I am making my assumptions based on current management staying in charge and the current plan is left in place.  Even with that, $50 is the minimum price I expect us to reach by the end of 2021.",

            "I like a good read. I\u2019m not dumb until I place a decision.   One thing that stud out though you said it was a dark time in life was tax issues. I have a small business that grossed 2 mil over 4 years. I didn\u2019t pay business or personal taxes like a idiot. I owe 10% sales tax on the revenue created and roughly 30% with deductions on personal income.   This year I\u2019m clearing everything up as I\u2019m going divorce of a 10 yr marriage.   I had so much opportunity to clear issues up in my life and thankful I handled some. I put more money in the market this year this years past, 20k and blew it all on options and forex trading. I\u2019m a routine lurker and occasional poster when I see fit.   This next year I\u2019m planning to get back focused on my business and getting out of my head so much. Still looking to trade and invest but needing to concentrate better strategies to be more profitable.  Anyways I\u2019m in California, my business taxes were filed for 2016-2018 so I have some documentation to move forward with but I started to destroy smooth banking operations I had once I got into trading. You know trying to keep up with $4000 thousand dollar a month rent, running a small business, having 5 kids, and think I was the shit.  Ended up fucking off my whole operation. So my question is, what can I expect? I don\u2019t have crazy savings or stock accounts cause I blow everything I deposit. My bills are to high, including 2500 monthly child support.   So basically I\u2019m not sitting on gold bricks to give the irs just capable to producing 5-10k for my Self and a monthly gross of 30-50k business revenue.   So if you don\u2019t mind describing that time for you a little more because I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m screwed. I hope this year by filing all my taxes, hopefully setting a payment plan, and being on time with filings going forward that I can reduce fears.   Merry Christmas I appreciate your time to post and share your experience, this is what I come to the net for. I need this motivation to keep pushing. I\u2019m convinced that I do the same soon with my business profits. I too am looking for a way out. I have a good business don\u2019t get me wrong but with 5 children I worry for their future and I want to make sure I\u2019m doing the most for that. I can\u2019t only let everybody else win and I not. In fact that\u2019s how I hustled my way to California.",

Bad thing is, this app only has a few hundred different stocks you can buy/sell. Good thing is, I can wait to withdraw this money in 2021, maybe even 2022, and pay my taxes for that year instead of this year. This is legal where I live, the tax man only cares about my bank account income statements for now. It could change in the future.

In your retard opinion, am I shooting myself in the foot too much for trying to postpone taxes eating away some of my current gains?

My europoor broker app (Revolut) only allows buying and selling of shares. I figured good, because at least I won't gamble my money away on retarded YOLO plays like those WSB autists.

Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.  Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.   Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.   Price go up to $14.85. I wait for dip.  Price go up to $15.85. ***I wait for dip***.  Dip to $15.4. ***I FOMO hard YOLO in all my spare cash.***  Own 231 GME shares.

            "Buying AAPL since I turned 20 and found out what a stock was.  My 20s and early 30s were spent on some Motley Fool subscriptions which actually have reasonable DD and were responsible for some serious gains over the years.  Then I got Robinhood in mid 2018 and the ducking wheels came off the car once I got deep into options. 2018-2019 was a gold rush, man. Flipping calls for 100% overnight (had I held any of those leaps I would have been looking at 2000+% now... live and learn!) and trading in the AM while the dog shits on neighbour\u2019s lawns.  2020 was the year of theta plays for me, and it\u2019s been pretty good so far. About $100k gain (50% return on cash) and potentially another $50k next week if $ABNB can get its pump on back to $165 for me.  Maybe once the world is sane again I\u2019ll start spending and enjoying this money, but until then keep stacking it up.  ALWAYS TAKE PROFITS!

Decided I was going to actively manage in Sept of 2019. In February of 2020 decided the 30% gain I had made in 3 years was too good to be true and went all cash, yes I said February. When markets started to go south I thought holy fuck I am literally the smartest person alive and I can buy this massive 10% dip! Panic sold after next 5%. Holy fuck another 10% dip to buy! Panic sold the next 5% Market bottoms and at that point I am so shit scared to lose everything I wait to get in until April.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.   Well, it\u2019s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD\u2019s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week.

I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with.

I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays.

So be careful with trading many people get too consumed and can go down a very dark path.

I am no expert on day trading but I have found stock selection is key to making money and trading when the odds are in your favor for your strategy. I focus on momentum and if I pick the wrong stocks I get chewed up.  Did that on Monday and Tuesday in tsla giving back over 20k to tsla after making 30k on Friday.

            "Been trading on/off since 2008. For years bought shares and held. Made all the mistakes. Chased all kinds of tickers. It is dumb unless you have a huge pot to work with. How to reduce the time to increase the pot? Now I use a system where input (income, gains) goes into options for a chance to increase considerably in a short amount of time. I try for 100%. Usually I buy 3, 6 or 12 month calls on tickers I follow closely. I only buy calls when the ticker is down. Only buy on blood red days. Only calls. I gave up trying to be smarter(puts) than everyone else years ago. Losers do that unless they are at a serious firm with millions in resources. The rest of us can\u2019t play that game.   The long duration gives me plenty of time to get out with some type of gain. After a few months if the company or market isn\u2019t buzzing I start to figure out a sale price. Usually these are like 15% gain trades.   I think a lot about what the next 3-12 months look like and then pick a trade once I feel convinced something is going to happen.   Like I am convinced Benioff talked to a lot of customers and internal data and it said buying Slack is just what his customers want. I spread 10k out across calls for next year through dec. These will be easy triples for me. I don\u2019t watch them that much until 1 month out and I almost always sell the calls a few weeks before expire. I\u2019ve lost a lot of gains in the last week or two cause of this rule, but it gives someone else plenty of upside and my risk is lowered.   Sounds boring waiting for 6 or 12 months but once you\u2019re going, each month you should have 1-3 trades ready to close and gains to recycle or bank. 6 months ago I knew video games would be massive this year, so that was my holiday focus. Felt like nothing could eff that up even the election.   Post election I waited for weed stocks to get real cheap and loaded like crazy for 1 year out. I think the right weed LEAPS will make 1000%+ gains over 12 months. Bank it.   The Bank is the ultimate goal. The big pot. I use an app based managed fund that I set to the most aggressive setting. It is up 30% on the year. Twice I have sold it and bought back in, once in early March once in mid Oct.   When I sell contracts I take 70% to Bank and 30% Input for new round of trades.

            "What I\u2019m not necessarily confident in (longer term) is the sustainability of originators like UWM given current and future market conditions for their moat. UWM is not the only player in the game (far from it). SoFI, Rocket (Quicken Loans), Better Mortgage (best of them all thus far as admitted by friends of mine who work for Rocket) are also players in the field and are far more tech-reliant than UWM. UWM maintains the customer-&gt;sales person-&gt;Underwriting cycle in their process while Better Mortgage for instance eliminated (in essence) the salesperson from the equation (which for the most part was my personal reason of going with them). So take that part of it into consideration as well since it is becoming the new norm (see Carvana in another space which is doing really well by eliminating that \u201coverhead\u201d to lessen the burden on the customer/end user). Furthermore, I (personally) think we\u2019ll see higher rates coming sooner than later which will make the appeal factor of these companies dwindle since they simply won\u2019t generate as much revenue due to lesser demand (refi is their bread and butter at the moment - somewhere above 60% of business for all the aforementioned companies). This also depends on your position - if you got in at or near NAV ($10-ish) take some profits when you see fit (50% seems like a good starting point for sure) then let the rest ride as you see fit. You should also keep in mind the reason for companies like this going public: either they need their initial investors to cash out (not the case with UWM as it was mostly funded by their revenues), OR they foresee a reduction in business coming up which will result in a need for other means of funding  (shareholders) to supplement their cash flow. Just FYI: I am overly cautious when it comes to long term investment and maintain a healthy dose of skepticism so as to not get burned. Hope this helps, take it with a grain of salt and may you be blessed with many tendies. Cheers!",

            "What is your background? I am a big believer in genomics too. however i have been reading a lot and it seems like science is just not there yet. We just don\u2019t understand genetic underpinnings of most complex diseases. Apart from monogenic diseases, most diseases are caused by many different genetic mutations and environment so a tool such as crispr while revolutionary for basic science is simply not adequate. Also it seems like crispr has its limitations. I read that cas9 is error prone and cutting DNA seems to cause an aging like effect on the cell. I was surprised to learn crsr fixed sickle cell on human patient. This is very promising but a lot of genetics/biotech seems to come up with miracle cures on lab only to fail phase III.

            "The first poster is right imo:  3D Printing will only be useful for prototypes. Sure you can \"print\" a house but it's not as efficient and good quality as building a functioning home.  3D Printing for everything related to metals if suboptimal, because different types of \"Gussanlagen\" (no idea of the english word) are way more efficient.  3D Printing organs might be useful later on, but I don't have the medical expertise to make an assumption.  Relating to ai.  Most ai is actually algorithm based and not real ai. Machine learning is logically possible but every ai are just good executed algorithms (amazon recommended items for example).  I think the business model of for example invtae is much more applicable to the masses then crispr and I think 3D printing will only be useful for prototypes  because the special designed machines are more useful in the industry.  Disclaimer: english is not my first language and I am not able to write down my thoughts as well as I would like.",

There is tremendous value add for 3D printing applications that can fabricate complex prototypes at a fraction of the speed and cost of a human fabricator. Idk what you\u2019re saying about metals, but that\u2019s not what I was banking on anyways. Even products that go into final production using metal can be prototyped with high strength polycarbonate  AI: \u201cTrue\u201d AI as you describe it is the holy grail of machine learning lol. Of course no one has it yet. Advanced algorithms as they current exist still outperform humans in many areas and will only get better.

            "Any thoughts on the possibility of crispr or similar science in treating aging? I am interested in this space but it is still really young. I actually just saw a documentary which had some good points:  - The life expectancy of a 70 y/o today is only 7 years better now than it was 180 years ago. - Aging is the primary cause of the most deadly and expensive diseases (chronic diseases) - 86% of healthcare spending goes towards treating chronic diseases.   - Curing all cancers would likely only increase average life expectancy by 4 years because people will just die of something else.  - FDA doesn\u2019t recognize aging as treatable   The open question is can old age be treated/prevented/cured?   Some of the science around metformin and IGF-1 seems promising but I don\u2019t see anything serious materializing any time soon."

            "I like a good read. I\u2019m not dumb until I place a decision.   One thing that stud out though you said it was a dark time in life was tax issues. I have a small business that grossed 2 mil over 4 years. I didn\u2019t pay business or personal taxes like a idiot. I owe 10% sales tax on the revenue created and roughly 30% with deductions on personal income.   This year I\u2019m clearing everything up as I\u2019m going divorce of a 10 yr marriage.   I had so much opportunity to clear issues up in my life and thankful I handled some. I put more money in the market this year this years past, 20k and blew it all on options and forex trading. I\u2019m a routine lurker and occasional poster when I see fit.   This next year I\u2019m planning to get back focused on my business and getting out of my head so much. Still looking to trade and invest but needing to concentrate better strategies to be more profitable.  Anyways I\u2019m in California, my business taxes were filed for 2016-2018 so I have some documentation to move forward with but I started to destroy smooth banking operations I had once I got into trading. You know trying to keep up with $4000 thousand dollar a month rent, running a small business, having 5 kids, and think I was the shit.  Ended up fucking off my whole operation. So my question is, what can I expect? I don\u2019t have crazy savings or stock accounts cause I blow everything I deposit. My bills are to high, including 2500 monthly child support.   So basically I\u2019m not sitting on gold bricks to give the irs just capable to producing 5-10k for my Self and a monthly gross of 30-50k business revenue.   So if you don\u2019t mind describing that time for you a little more because I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m screwed. I hope this year by filing all my taxes, hopefully setting a payment plan, and being on time with filings going forward that I can reduce fears.   Merry Christmas I appreciate your time to post and share your experience, this is what I come to the net for. I need this motivation to keep pushing. I\u2019m convinced that I do the same soon with my business profits. I too am looking for a way out. I have a good business don\u2019t get me wrong but with 5 children I worry for their future and I want to make sure I\u2019m doing the most for that. I can\u2019t only let everybody else win and I not. In fact that\u2019s how I hustled my way to California.",

            "I'm currently using an europoor money transfer/management app (Revolut), which also offers 'buy/sell shares' functionality as an afterthought.  I'm all in on GME, so I'm good for now. Bad thing is, this app only has a few hundred different stocks you can buy/sell. Good thing is, I can wait to withdraw this money in 2021, maybe even 2022, and pay my taxes for that year instead of this year. This is legal where I live, the tax man only cares about my bank account income statements for now. It could change in the future. I have microdick budget ($4.6k) and I didn't lie my way into Interactive Brokers or some other more reputable platform that want big dick $20k+ budget investors.  In your retard opinion, am I shooting myself in the foot too much for trying to postpone taxes eating away some of my current gains? In other words, is the downside of not having access to thousands of different stocks outweighing the upside of tax reporting flexibility?  For example, I couldn't do your STIC play, because there's no STIC in Revolut.   Thank you and [DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) for confirming my GME conviction btw.

Knew about WSB from a few YouTube videos where they talked badly about you autists, but wasn't being active in the sub, or even lurking back then.   My europoor broker app (Revolut) only allows buying and selling of shares. I figured good, because at least I won't gamble my money away on retarded YOLO plays like those WSB autists.  Bought my first stock (HAS) on August 14 2020.  Tried boomervesting, owning 69.4209001 diversified ass shares. After 1.5 months, made $5 profit on a $1000 investment. Fuck that shit. Sold everything off.  Knew about GME stock at that time, cuz I saw Michael Bury owning bigly shares. Become obsessed.    ***\"Why does Big Short guy own this dying company?\"***    Did a detailed DD on my own, back in September, before I even knew this sub was slowly getting obsessed with the same stock I was getting obsessed with.  Became a GME believer right then and there, months before joining WSB. Didn't have the balls to go all in. Fucking idiot. Fucking moron.  Tried the REGN Trump pump. Lost money.   Fuck it - started paperhanding GME on November 17.   Became active in WSB late November/early December. I feel like a retard at home here.  Received hate on WSB for paperhanding GME. Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.  Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.   Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.   Price go up to $14.85. I wait for dip.  Price go up to $15.85. ***I wait for dip***.  Dip to $15.4. ***I FOMO hard YOLO in all my spare cash.***  Own 231 GME shares.

My 20s and early 30s were spent on some Motley Fool subscriptions which actually have reasonable DD and were responsible for some serious gains over the years.  Then I got Robinhood in mid 2018 and the ducking wheels came off the car once I got deep into options. 2018-2019 was a gold rush, man. Flipping calls for 100% overnight (had I held any of those leaps I would have been looking at 2000+% now... live and learn!) and trading in the AM while the dog shits on neighbour\u2019s lawns.  2020 was the year of theta plays for me, and it\u2019s been pretty good so far. About $100k gain (50% return on cash) and potentially another $50k next week if $ABNB can get its pump on back to $165 for me.  Maybe once the world is sane again I\u2019ll start spending and enjoying this money, but until then keep stacking it up.  ALWAYS TAKE PROFITS!

I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

I pussied out of every good play I had and did nothing until early august. Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.   Well, it\u2019s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD\u2019s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week. But never believed in my plays that ran no matter how many times I was proved right.   Throughout the month of august until now I have bought nothing and I\u2019m down to my last $700 cause bills raping me, everyday I tell myself I\u2019ll buy, I\u2019ll trust my gut, and fight with myself etc, and nothing changes. My parents think I have my money still and I have not spoke to any friends in months. I never thought I\u2019d let myself get this far down everyday since July 24th I wake up at 7 and watch the market until close and have done nothing but not trust my gut and it\u2019s fucked me over.

            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).",

I really got interested in stocks after starting my 401k and then I stumbled onto options and wsb. I bought spy calls and nio options and other weekly fds which did well before March to April where stonks went flat and I lost 3k after buying like dumb ass nio calls with no volume so there was literally no buyer for a week and a half as I watched it bleed to 0. I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays. I joined theta gang and started the wheel. Now I am proud of my portfolio and occasionally yolo on stuff like gme, steel, or other spacs which is the new cool thing into tendies.",

            "Been messing with the market off an on since 2002.  My brother basically probably had some sort of a mental problem and he went full on degenerate and borrowed money on his credit cards to fund his trading accounts.... it didn't work out shocker... he actually had a good credit score too and was able to screw the banks for a good 100k plus.  So be careful with trading many people get too consumed and can go down a very dark path.  Got myself into a flipping business back in 2013 and that has made me more money than I ever though possible.  It also wasn't very time consuming so I got back into day trading in Oct 2018.   Broke even 2018 and small profit for 2019 but 2020 I am up over 200k now for the year.  Might not sound like much compared to sir jack me off but it isn't chump change.  And it also a gain not a loss which is the more typical result of day trading.  I am no expert on day trading but I have found stock selection is key to making money and trading when the odds are in your favor for your strategy. I focus on momentum and if I pick the wrong stocks I get chewed up.  Did that on Monday and Tuesday in tsla giving back over 20k to tsla after making 30k on Friday.  Luckily stopped fucking with tsla yesterday and traded baba on the news move for a 14k gain.  So now I'm only 10k off my ath for profits this year.",

            "Been trading on/off since 2008. For years bought shares and held. Made all the mistakes. Chased all kinds of tickers. It is dumb unless you have a huge pot to work with. How to reduce the time to increase the pot? Now I use a system where input (income, gains) goes into options for a chance to increase considerably in a short amount of time. I try for 100%. Usually I buy 3, 6 or 12 month calls on tickers I follow closely. I only buy calls when the ticker is down. Only buy on blood red days. Only calls. I gave up trying to be smarter(puts) than everyone else years ago. Losers do that unless they are at a serious firm with millions in resources. The rest of us can\u2019t play that game.   The long duration gives me plenty of time to get out with some type of gain. After a few months if the company or market isn\u2019t buzzing I start to figure out a sale price. Usually these are like 15% gain trades.   I think a lot about what the next 3-12 months look like and then pick a trade once I feel convinced something is going to happen.   Like I am convinced Benioff talked to a lot of customers and internal data and it said buying Slack is just what his customers want. I spread 10k out across calls for next year through dec. These will be easy triples for me. I don\u2019t watch them that much until 1 month out and I almost always sell the calls a few weeks before expire. I\u2019ve lost a lot of gains in the last week or two cause of this rule, but it gives someone else plenty of upside and my risk is lowered.   Sounds boring waiting for 6 or 12 months but once you\u2019re going, each month you should have 1-3 trades ready to close and gains to recycle or bank. 6 months ago I knew video games would be massive this year, so that was my holiday focus. Felt like nothing could eff that up even the election.   Post election I waited for weed stocks to get real cheap and loaded like crazy for 1 year out. I think the right weed LEAPS will make 1000%+ gains over 12 months. Bank it.   The Bank is the ultimate goal. The big pot. I use an app based managed fund that I set to the most aggressive setting. It is up 30% on the year. Twice I have sold it and bought back in, once in early March once in mid Oct.   When I sell contracts I take 70% to Bank and 30% Input for new round of trades. Don\u2019t break this rule. Get profits to bank.   Trading account is up 230% since May at $35k. Started with $10k ,in this account.

            "What I\u2019m not necessarily confident in (longer term) is the sustainability of originators like UWM given current and future market conditions for their moat. UWM is not the only player in the game (far from it). SoFI, Rocket (Quicken Loans), Better Mortgage (best of them all thus far as admitted by friends of mine who work for Rocket) are also players in the field and are far more tech-reliant than UWM. UWM maintains the customer-&gt;sales person-&gt;Underwriting cycle in their process while Better Mortgage for instance eliminated (in essence) the salesperson from the equation (which for the most part was my personal reason of going with them). So take that part of it into consideration as well since it is becoming the new norm (see Carvana in another space which is doing really well by eliminating that \u201coverhead\u201d to lessen the burden on the customer/end user). Furthermore, I (personally) think we\u2019ll see higher rates coming sooner than later which will make the appeal factor of these companies dwindle since they simply won\u2019t generate as much revenue due to lesser demand (refi is their bread and butter at the moment - somewhere above 60% of business for all the aforementioned companies). This also depends on your position - if you got in at or near NAV ($10-ish) take some profits when you see fit (50% seems like a good starting point for sure) then let the rest ride as you see fit. You should also keep in mind the reason for companies like this going public: either they need their initial investors to cash out (not the case with UWM as it was mostly funded by their revenues), OR they foresee a reduction in business coming up which will result in a need for other means of funding  (shareholders) to supplement their cash flow. Just FYI: I am overly cautious when it comes to long term investment and maintain a healthy dose of skepticism so as to not get burned. Hope this helps, take it with a grain of salt and may you be blessed with many tendies. Cheers!",

            "What is your background? I am a big believer in genomics too. however i have been reading a lot and it seems like science is just not there yet. We just don\u2019t understand genetic underpinnings of most complex diseases. Apart from monogenic diseases, most diseases are caused by many different genetic mutations and environment so a tool such as crispr while revolutionary for basic science is simply not adequate. Also it seems like crispr has its limitations. I read that cas9 is error prone and cutting DNA seems to cause an aging like effect on the cell. I was surprised to learn crsr fixed sickle cell on human patient. This is very promising but a lot of genetics/biotech seems to come up with miracle cures on lab only to fail phase III.   I am not doubting you. Just truly want to understand this and hopefully ride this once in a lifetime opportunity. What do you think about these points? Also what is your background?",

            "The first poster is right imo:  3D Printing will only be useful for prototypes. Sure you can \"print\" a house but it's not as efficient and good quality as building a functioning home.  3D Printing for everything related to metals if suboptimal, because different types of \"Gussanlagen\" (no idea of the english word) are way more efficient.  3D Printing organs might be useful later on, but I don't have the medical expertise to make an assumption.  Relating to ai.  Most ai is actually algorithm based and not real ai. Machine learning is logically possible but every ai are just good executed algorithms (amazon recommended items for example).  I think the business model of for example invtae is much more applicable to the masses then crispr and I think 3D printing will only be useful for prototypes  because the special designed machines are more useful in the industry.  Disclaimer: english is not my first language and I am not able to write down my thoughts as well as I would like.",
            "Quick counterargument here cuz I\u2019m With family but:  Yes, 3D printing is primarily good for rapid prototyping. That is why I am bullish on it lol. There is tremendous value add for 3D printing applications that can fabricate complex prototypes at a fraction of the speed and cost of a human fabricator. Idk what you\u2019re saying about metals, but that\u2019s not what I was banking on anyways. Even products that go into final production using metal can be prototyped with high strength polycarbonate  AI: \u201cTrue\u201d AI as you describe it is the holy grail of machine learning lol. Of course no one has it yet. Advanced algorithms as they current exist still outperform humans in many areas and will only get better. Machine learning will benefit from the trends of Big Data and cloud computing and move towards what I think you are picturing when you say \u201creal AI.\u201d",
            "Any thoughts on the possibility of crispr or similar science in treating aging? I am interested in this space but it is still really young. I actually just saw a documentary which had some good points:  - The life expectancy of a 70 y/o today is only 7 years better now than it was 180 years ago. - Aging is the primary cause of the most deadly and expensive diseases (chronic diseases) - 86% of healthcare spending goes towards treating chronic diseases.   - Curing all cancers would likely only increase average life expectancy by 4 years because people will just die of something else.  - FDA doesn\u2019t recognize aging as treatable   The open question is can old age be treated/prevented/cured?   Some of the science around metformin and IGF-1 seems promising but I don\u2019t see anything serious materializing any time soon."

            "2016, started to get interested in stocks and had my boomer of a dad put some money into Chevron and Ford. Ford never really panned out, but Chevron did and I/we sold around $30 profit/share. When I turned 18 is when I hopped on robinhood, made some gains here and there buying low and selling high on some small company stocks.   I was in Engineering in college but then decided it wasn\u2019t my thing, switched to a Supply Chain major which involved taking a shitload of Accounting, Finance, Management, and etc type classes where I learned a bit about Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Risk Management. Made a rookie move back in March and sold as soon as I heard COVID was coming, didn\u2019t buy back in either (I was holding Tesla and Apple, for some reason turned bearish). Learned my lesson from that. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research/analysis and picking options without putting any actual money in them because losing a few hundred is devastating to a college student and I\u2019m not as ballsy as some of you fuckers.

            "Buying AAPL since I turned 20 and found out what a stock was.  My 20s and early 30s were spent on some Motley Fool subscriptions which actually have reasonable DD and were responsible for some serious gains over the years.  Then I got Robinhood in mid 2018 and the ducking wheels came off the car once I got deep into options. 2018-2019 was a gold rush, man. Flipping calls for 100% overnight (had I held any of those leaps I would have been looking at 2000+% now... live and learn!) and trading in the AM while the dog shits on neighbour\u2019s lawns.  2020 was the year of theta plays for me, and it\u2019s been pretty good so far. About $100k gain (50% return on cash) and potentially another $50k next week if $ABNB can get its pump on back to $165 for me.  Maybe once the world is sane again I\u2019ll start spending and enjoying this money, but until then keep stacking it up.  ALWAYS TAKE PROFITS!

Traded 3x long VIX in 2018, made a few thousand going all in a few times and quickly lost everything in one trade (Actually went negative).   Six years later and it was the cheapest education ever. Only ever lost $120 and now I've realized enough to pay my tuition and still have 20k of house money to play around with.",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

            "I joined wallstreetbets in December of last year. I was trying to learn as much as I could about the stock market before I received an inheritance of 21 pre split AAPL shares that were worth about 7k at the time. I opened up my E*TRADE account in January, deposited $1,000 and started trading in February. I was able to double my money by trading TMUS calls before their merger with sprint. I was so excited about my first big gain. After I had 2k in my account I received the inheritance, which brought my account value up to 9k. Late February volatility brought my account value down to 7k and then I started buying puts and straddles. My account went from 7k to 15k in March and I withdrew 8k. This accounted for my initial investment plus my inheritance plus 1k in profits.   I didn\u2019t touch the my account again until about July. Since I bought LEAPS close to the bottom of the crash, my account was up to 10k. After dropping from 7k- 5k. I traded through august and until September 2nd and was able to make my account value 25k from tech calls. I of course didn\u2019t sell and got dropped back down to 15k in September. This fall was very volatile and I bounced around from 23k to 14k. This month I hit 20k again and withdrew 2k into my bank account and put 1k into an IRA.   That\u2019s my story.",

Understand basics of pricing and theta decay.  3. Apple will always be around and will always do well. If you want to try and use those gains for a more aggressive strategy then I'd say liquidate it (or at least partially) and play around with those giants.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

I was so excited about my first big gain. After I had 2k in my account I received the inheritance, which brought my account value up to 9k. Late February volatility brought my account value down to 7k and then I started buying puts and straddles. My account went from 7k to 15k in March and I withdrew 8k. This accounted for my initial investment plus my inheritance plus 1k in profits.   I didn\u2019t touch the my account again until about July. Since I bought LEAPS close to the bottom of the crash, my account was up to 10k. After dropping from 7k- 5k. I traded through august and until September 2nd and was able to make my account value 25k from tech calls. I of course didn\u2019t sell and got dropped back down to 15k in September.

Got a huge distribution payout from my startup company and threw it all into rh. On September 1st - 11th I blew 70% of my account on aapl and tsla calls. Value of my port went from 63k to &lt;20k. From there I started yoloing in random things such as spce, amd, aal, docu, cvna, before taking a big drop down to 4K. I sat at 4K from October to November when I finally got a hot tip about solar. I dumped everything into CSIQ calls for December and January when it was around $38 per share. Earlier this week, CSIQ pumped around 20% thus rocketing my port back to a respectable 42k. Still need about 20k to get even but dude 63k&gt;4k&gt;42k is seriously the best Christmas present ever.

Was down about 30k at one point but I just passed break even last week and am now up 5% for the year.   Now I am theta gang and shares with the occasional yolo and have been making steady gains every month.   Looking forward to 2021 now that I popped my trading cherry.   Positions.

Crisper, Virgin Galactic, Cloudflare, AMD, Tesla and a 1500 dollar gain on quantumscape that I got lucky on. Sold all of my Tesla and QS and put it in Apple and ARKK.",

I was in a good place because I was teaching at the college, but they didn't like me because I was a white guy.  Over the summer, I made good money teaching summer sessions, and in the later part of summer, had a great gig with the census where I pulled in about 17k in two months.    I had about 50k in assets but was getting hungry.  I wish I knew how accessible options were.  Up to about 100k in assets, and am tits deep in BFT and GME with some longer option calls here and there.    Found WSB when I looked up on the internet what the hell was that stock that the motley fool was recommending.  It was some shit.  Found r/stocks, then found /WSB.    Now I have a sense of options, but also a sense of lament that I didn't buy  50 shares of apple with my 1k in college in 2004 and instead bought a shit stock called ONSE.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",
            "Started educating myself in late feb/early March after seeing a meme on Facebook about investing in travel stocks. Put 10k into the market in April trading Cineworld and made a nice 5k. Moved onto the travel sector (bringing a friend on board at this point) and we traded CCL, NCLH, DAL and AAL and I\u2019d taken my account to 25k up until June 8th. Started a horrendous losing streak because I\u2019d get scared and close my positions early all the time. I went all the way back down to 12k before we started trading NIO months ago. I\u2019m now up to 65k with 80% of my equity in shared and 20% in options. Current positions are NIO and PLTR.",
            "I bought 5,000 CCL stocks at $8 and sold them at $23 each. It was a good year until I bought WISH stock and lost 20 percent of my portfolio balance. I cashed out yesterday. Feel good. A stock market correction could happen soon.",
            "Been trading on/off since 2008. For years bought shares and held. Made all the mistakes. Chased all kinds of tickers. It is dumb unless you have a huge pot to work with. How to reduce the time to increase the pot? Now I use a system where input (income, gains) goes into options for a chance to increase considerably in a short amount of time. I try for 100%. Usually I buy 3, 6 or 12 month calls on tickers I follow closely. I only buy calls when the ticker is down. Only buy on blood red days. Only calls. I gave up trying to be smarter(puts) than everyone else years ago. Losers do that unless they are at a serious firm with millions in resources. The rest of us can\u2019t play that game.   The long duration gives me plenty of time to get out with some type of gain. After a few months if the company or market isn\u2019t buzzing I start to figure out a sale price. Usually these are like 15% gain trades.   I think a lot about what the next 3-12 months look like and then pick a trade once I feel convinced something is going to happen.   Like I am convinced Benioff talked to a lot of customers and internal data and it said buying Slack is just what his customers want. I spread 10k out across calls for next year through dec. These will be easy triples for me. I don\u2019t watch them that much until 1 month out and I almost always sell the calls a few weeks before expire. I\u2019ve lost a lot of gains in the last week or two cause of this rule, but it gives someone else plenty of upside and my risk is lowered.   Sounds boring waiting for 6 or 12 months but once you\u2019re going, each month you should have 1-3 trades ready to close and gains to recycle or bank. 6 months ago I knew video games would be massive this year, so that was my holiday focus. Felt like nothing could eff that up even the election.   Post election I waited for weed stocks to get real cheap and loaded like crazy for 1 year out. I think the right weed LEAPS will make 1000%+ gains over 12 months. Bank it.   The Bank is the ultimate goal. The big pot. I use an app based managed fund that I set to the most aggressive setting. It is up 30% on the year. Twice I have sold it and bought back in, once in early March once in mid Oct.   When I sell contracts I take 70% to Bank and 30% Input for new round of trades.

            "I started by buying CCL when it dropped down to $15 in April. Sold at like $20 when it briefly bounced back up. Sat on it for months, didn't have time to do DD.   I don't mess with options, but may add covered leaps of my portfolio gets big.   I bought into PLTR and BFT about 6 and 3 weeks ago. Holding looooooonng. Up 17% lifetime.",
            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",
            "Started educating myself in late feb/early March after seeing a meme on Facebook about investing in travel stocks. Put 10k into the market in April trading Cineworld and made a nice 5k. Moved onto the travel sector (bringing a friend on board at this point) and we traded CCL, NCLH, DAL and AAL and I\u2019d taken my account to 25k up until June 8th. Started a horrendous losing streak because I\u2019d get scared and close my positions early all the time. I went all the way back down to 12k before we started trading NIO months ago. I\u2019m now up to 65k with 80% of my equity in shared and 20% in options. Current positions are NIO and PLTR.",
            "I bought 5,000 CCL stocks at $8 and sold them at $23 each. It was a good year until I bought WISH stock and lost 20 percent of my portfolio balance. I cashed out yesterday. Feel good. A stock market correction could happen soon.",
            "Been trading on/off since 2008. For years bought shares and held. Made all the mistakes. Chased all kinds of tickers. It is dumb unless you have a huge pot to work with. How to reduce the time to increase the pot? Now I use a system where input (income, gains) goes into options for a chance to increase considerably in a short amount of time. I try for 100%. Usually I buy 3, 6 or 12 month calls on tickers I follow closely. I only buy calls when the ticker is down. Only buy on blood red days. Only calls. I gave up trying to be smarter(puts) than everyone else years ago. Losers do that unless they are at a serious firm with millions in resources. The rest of us can\u2019t play that game.   The long duration gives me plenty of time to get out with some type of gain. After a few months if the company or market isn\u2019t buzzing I start to figure out a sale price. Usually these are like 15% gain trades.   I think a lot about what the next 3-12 months look like and then pick a trade once I feel convinced something is going to happen.   Like I am convinced Benioff talked to a lot of customers and internal data and it said buying Slack is just what his customers want. I spread 10k out across calls for next year through dec. These will be easy triples for me. I don\u2019t watch them that much until 1 month out and I almost always sell the calls a few weeks before expire. I\u2019ve lost a lot of gains in the last week or two cause of this rule, but it gives someone else plenty of upside and my risk is lowered.   Sounds boring waiting for 6 or 12 months but once you\u2019re going, each month you should have 1-3 trades ready to close and gains to recycle or bank. 6 months ago I knew video games would be massive this year, so that was my holiday focus. Felt like nothing could eff that up even the election.   Post election I waited for weed stocks to get real cheap and loaded like crazy for 1 year out. I think the right weed LEAPS will make 1000%+ gains over 12 months. Bank it.   The Bank is the ultimate goal. The big pot. I use an app based managed fund that I set to the most aggressive setting. It is up 30% on the year. Twice I have sold it and bought back in, once in early March once in mid Oct.   When I sell contracts I take 70% to Bank and 30% Input for new round of trades. Don\u2019t break this rule. Get profits to bank.   Trading account is up 230% since May at $35k. Started with $10k ,in this account. Currently have 10 trades open across TTWO, IPOC, OPEN, CRM, UPS, LLY, CCL",

If you want to try and use those gains for a more aggressive strategy then I'd say liquidate it (or at least partially) and play around with those giants.

            "&gt; GME is a financially healthy company  How do you figure? They haven\u2019t turned a profit since 2017 and have had steadily declining revenues every year for the last decade. The only way they have been able to stay cash flow positive has been through investing and financing activities. Operating cash flows have been negative for years. The balance sheet is a disaster as well. Book equity is about half of what it was a year ago, and it\u2019s going to turn to negative equity if they have a 1-2 more years of operations similar to 2020.  I really don\u2019t understand how this dying brick and mortar dinosaur which absolutely will be extinct within 5 years has somehow has become the wsb meme de jour. I understand that it\u2019s a short squeeze play but that has nothing to do with the underlying fundamentals of the company\u2019s financials, which are a train wreck.

Have to be catalysts for the next 1-2 years since that is how long my trades go out. Then it\u2019s understanding the risks that would invalidate my thesis which is how i determine my risk tolerance. The winners are the ones that are the clear leader of their group, with the least amount of risk. So for semiconductor companies, the single leader (in my opinion) is Nvidia. Why? Because the fundamentals are super solid, they have a great history of consistently beating earnings, and when you look at the future and where we are going, Nvidias GPUs and DPUs are literally powering that future. Then you look at the risks and the biggest risk is this trade war and supply chain issues. When I compare the bull case to the bear case, the bull case is a much stronger argument. That is how you identify winners. Find the best sectors, best industries, and then the best companies within them. Look at the future and what society needs and the market needs and it will naturally guide you there. I only look at technicals until I have a fully formed investment idea, technicals are just there for entries and exits.   Good way to start is sit down with a blank sheet of paper and think about what our future looks like in 5-10 years then work backwards and figure out which companies will play the biggest most important role in that future.",

I had known about DraftKings for years and thought it was an absolute beast of a company. Full ATM machine/ print money at will. Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

            "I was 19 and my told me about it in March and just ignored him, I did a little trading in June and stopped I was up $200. I came back in July and yolod my life savings (10.5k) in RH.   I pussied out of every good play I had and did nothing until early august. Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.   Well, it\u2019s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD\u2019s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week. But never believed in my plays that ran no matter how many times I was proved right.   Throughout the month of august until now I have bought nothing and I\u2019m down to my last $700 cause bills raping me, everyday I tell myself I\u2019ll buy, I\u2019ll trust my gut, and fight with myself etc, and nothing changes. My parents think I have my money still and I have not spoke to any friends in months. I never thought I\u2019d let myself get this far down everyday since July 24th I wake up at 7 and watch the market until close and have done nothing but not trust my gut and it\u2019s fucked me over.   And I\u2019m at my last leg of desperation, my dealer offered to buy my car back 15-18k and I\u2019m gonna sell it. Deposit all of it in RH, turn on margin and start trading. I will either dig myself out of this hole or lose it all and Kill myself, no exceptions.",
            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).",
            "Started at the end of April this year with 2.5k and in a matter of weeks lost 1k. Managed to make it back to even but currently down 400 dollars. My best play was riding the NIO wave early on, making 400% profit on that position. I've certainly got better but still more progress to be made.",
            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",
            "Also 30 year old resident doctor, surgery resident. Started during COVID with around 4K. Lost money on every options play so staying with shares only.  Up ~250% all time.",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",
            "I started trading in high school and my first stock purchases, believe it or not, were Tesla &amp; Netflix before either reached $40.  Being a kid who didn't know anything, I sold both when I doubled my money, which was ~$6,000 to begin with.  I then took my money to the options world and lost all my gains by letting call options expire worthless because I didn't understand vega.  FFWD to the pandemic, I funded a futures account with $13.5k.  March crash sent that account to $90k in less than a month as I built up to 3 full ES contracts short.  Being full of myself, I traded like a moron until that account was back to $13k.  The emotional pain drove me to read and search for new strategies.  I spent some time in the Sosnoff camp selling options and quickly got bored.  I then read 7 books in a couple months and the one that changed me was Options Volatility &amp; Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  I began to study options pricing and learned everything I could about volatility.  I began scanning the market for low IV sector rotations and would scoop up the top 3-4 tickers by volume.  I stuck to using no more than 50% of cash, no more than 3% of acct value in one play, no less than 30 DTE and all the way up to 700DTE, and avoiding memes &amp; tech calls.  I began hitting home runs, in the last month my best call performers have been X, AA, DISCA, GE, MT, VALE, FCX, M, JWN, ABEV.",

Kept my head down until I felt secure enough to play with stocks again but not smooth brained enough for option diamond hands this year \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c. Missed PLUG, NIO, and the real JPlow printer money this year.   Got in PLTR at $20 and then again at $31. Still up 260% YTD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
            "You all have to understand that batching into positions does wonders for you. Same as what jesse Livermore stood by.  I usually take a started position for like 30_40% of what I really want, and once the confirmation is made, I'll add into it, or sell my small starter if it tricks me and breaks down. Also, i tell quick gains into bigger non volatile stocks. For example i made 22% on Tesla,  I'm not going to go throw it into PLTR cuz PLTR shares the same volatility as TSLA. so, I'll buy walmart or some other less volatile stock so that even if shit tanks, it wont tank nearly as much which means I'm protecting my profit. I  So yeah just scale into or out of your positions, also make sure you considered the true downside risk for every play, and put hot money into cold money stocks.",
            "I have two very different sides of the story, started with a Stash account September 2019, that has 5K in personal and 2K in either IRA is 62% YTD. I do not sell and buy that often there, maybe once a month. I have another 6K in Merrill since August and was doing very well until about a month ago (37% up) just trading stocks. I started playing with options a month ago and I'm down -12% YTD.  This is $ I allow myself to play and learn with, made some bad mistakes: sold JMIA 40c a day before expiration for a 40% loss and exploded the last day, was up 120% up on a SNOW put (first and only put) and got greedy and ended up selling for a 20% loss.

A couple years ago, I also started getting a 3% IRA match at work. So, with those alone, we're on track for a modest retirement.   This year, with daycare shut down, I suddenly had a bunch of extra money and decided to open a taxable account. It's mostly VTI, SPY, and UPRO, but I have been doing some meme stock trades for fun. Overall, up about 20% this year, and starting to play options a bit more.",
            "Started with $18k at 20 years old working as a line cook and going to community college as a philosophy major. Lost everything trading options. Invested my student loans and convinced my family to give me a small loan. I'm at $30k. I drop out of college. I wind up bagholding garbage weed penny stocks until I sell for a 50% loss. I go back to college. I trade to pay rent but never make a profit. Sell my car for $5500. Take out more student loans. Covid hits. I lose everything. I'm down to my last $1.9k. I don't leave my apartment for days. Shutdowns happen. I sit outside every evening to have a few beers and watch the sunset. I'm not depressed but I'm angry at myself. I don't remember what exactly set me off, but one evening I just got up and grabbed myself by the kohonas and decided that I start all over again for the umpteenth time. I swing trade travel and oil stocks for $25-$100 every day for months. My account starts getting bigger, so I'm making $100-$250 days now. I wake up at 3am and go to bed at 11pm everyday researching, planning, and watching my trades. I discover FUBO at $21. My account moons. I'm now making $300-$600 every day. I swing trade PLTR every day and my account moons again.   I'm 24 years old now and my account is sitting at $85k. I've made back everything I've ever lost and then some and average around $2.6k a day. I'm also going to into my last year of college as a Finance major.   As much as it hurts to watch dozens of WSBgods be born in this market, I realized that I don't have to make $1m overnight to be satisfied. The trick for me from the beginning was to avoid trying to hit those home runs and just take profit. Even if you're still confident in the trade. Also, play the trend. Don't try to be a top ticker. Lastly, have yourself with a couple of beers every now and then. For me, it helps my mind reset and evaluate my trading philosophy.   We're all going to make it.",
            "My story is I started trading back in late 2015 after I found robinhood. Few grand lost here and there. Took a break at 2017 after not much success. Basically trying to hit home runs, holding longer than I should have and mad fomoing. Dabbled in 2018 and 2019 didn\u2019t learn anything. Wasn\u2019t until the crash where I had a influx of cash March 2020, played a few options but mainly just bought stocks at the lows. Back in late March I was finally +% all time. Fast forward today I don\u2019t have any stocks in robinhood but just playing the long game on AAPL and small leaps on cruise lines about 25k total. up 120% this year and about 90% all time. My 5 year goal is just Apple. Suppose I can retire in 5 years if all goes well, sell my house and move to Thailand for 10 years and continue while my portfolio grows, while reducing COL by like 40-50%. Come back to America and maybe setup shop in Vegas (I love playing craps) Options is just play money for me, I don\u2019t spend much. I probably throw 30% of my income into retirement accounts.",
            "My story goes like this:     1.  Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.  (around 50kish total) By no means rich, still a small fish, but I now have enough $$$ to spread around my investments and hopefully make a lot of money in this coming up year.     **TL:DR =  Had nothing in 2016, made some trendies, have money now.**",
            "Started trading in June with 3K, SPACs only. Over the course of the next 6 months, I put in a few thousand from my check( most of my check) each month for a total of 20k year to date.

            "I've always had 150K plus in mutual funds through a traditional brokerage. Took 15K to play with, lost half buying SPY puts in March, then got scared and never invested an additional 70K I had to play with. In September I paper handed played with weed stocks. If I held I'd be up 100%. Bought back in with ARKK and ARKG and some others a few weeks back. Feel fucking dumb as a brick. However, my old school mutual funds made 30% this year, so I guess it was a success.",
            "Started looking into it in March. Started with $200 to play with and learn. Went up to maybe $500 dollars, dropped down to $300 and kind of forgot about it. Got more serious about a couple months ago and turned the $300 into 13k. So far I\u2019ve lost about 5k of the 13k lol",
            "Never make a play that will blow up your account. I like to stick to 2-3 or so tickers and let the retarrt strength of options lead to valhalla",
            "Been trading on/off since 2008. For years bought shares and held. Made all the mistakes. Chased all kinds of tickers. It is dumb unless you have a huge pot to work with. How to reduce the time to increase the pot? Now I use a system where input (income, gains) goes into options for a chance to increase considerably in a short amount of time. I try for 100%. Usually I buy 3, 6 or 12 month calls on tickers I follow closely. I only buy calls when the ticker is down. Only buy on blood red days. Only calls. I gave up trying to be smarter(puts) than everyone else years ago. Losers do that unless they are at a serious firm with millions in resources. The rest of us can\u2019t play that game.   The long duration gives me plenty of time to get out with some type of gain. After a few months if the company or market isn\u2019t buzzing I start to figure out a sale price. Usually these are like 15% gain trades.   I think a lot about what the next 3-12 months look like and then pick a trade once I feel convinced something is going to happen.   Like I am convinced Benioff talked to a lot of customers and internal data and it said buying Slack is just what his customers want. I spread 10k out across calls for next year through dec. These will be easy triples for me. I don\u2019t watch them that much until 1 month out and I almost always sell the calls a few weeks before expire. I\u2019ve lost a lot of gains in the last week or two cause of this rule, but it gives someone else plenty of upside and my risk is lowered.   Sounds boring waiting for 6 or 12 months but once you\u2019re going, each month you should have 1-3 trades ready to close and gains to recycle or bank. 6 months ago I knew video games would be massive this year, so that was my holiday focus. Felt like nothing could eff that up even the election.   Post election I waited for weed stocks to get real cheap and loaded like crazy for 1 year out. I think the right weed LEAPS will make 1000%+ gains over 12 months. Bank it.   The Bank is the ultimate goal. The big pot. I use an app based managed fund that I set to the most aggressive setting. It is up 30% on the year. Twice I have sold it and bought back in, once in early March once in mid Oct.   When I sell contracts I take 70% to Bank and 30% Input for new round of trades. Don\u2019t break this rule. Get profits to bank.   Trading account is up 230% since May at $35k. Started with $10k ,in this account. Currently have 10 trades open across TTWO, IPOC, OPEN, CRM, UPS, LLY, CCL",

Terpenes are not the \u201conly modulator in cannabis,\u201d but they definitely have an impact on the unique experience of each strain.

            "&gt; GME is a financially healthy company  How do you figure? They haven\u2019t turned a profit since 2017 and have had steadily declining revenues every year for the last decade. The only way they have been able to stay cash flow positive has been through investing and financing activities. Operating cash flows have been negative for years. The balance sheet is a disaster as well. Book equity is about half of what it was a year ago, and it\u2019s going to turn to negative equity if they have a 1-2 more years of operations similar to 2020.  I really don\u2019t understand how this dying brick and mortar dinosaur which absolutely will be extinct within 5 years has somehow has become the wsb meme de jour. I understand that it\u2019s a short squeeze play but that has nothing to do with the underlying fundamentals of the company\u2019s financials, which are a train wreck. This is NOT a financially healthy business. Buying this equity is a completely speculative play on the hope of a possible short squeeze.",

Have to be catalysts for the next 1-2 years since that is how long my trades go out. Then it\u2019s understanding the risks that would invalidate my thesis which is how i determine my risk tolerance. The winners are the ones that are the clear leader of their group, with the least amount of risk. So for semiconductor companies, the single leader (in my opinion) is Nvidia. Why? Because the fundamentals are super solid, they have a great history of consistently beating earnings, and when you look at the future and where we are going, Nvidias GPUs and DPUs are literally powering that future. Then you look at the risks and the biggest risk is this trade war and supply chain issues. When I compare the bull case to the bear case, the bull case is a much stronger argument. That is how you identify winners. Find the best sectors, best industries, and then the best companies within them. Look at the future and what society needs and the market needs and it will naturally guide you there. I only look at technicals until I have a fully formed investment idea, technicals are just there for entries and exits.   Good way to start is sit down with a blank sheet of paper and think about what our future looks like in 5-10 years then work backwards and figure out which companies will play the biggest most important role in that future.",

I had known about DraftKings for years and thought it was an absolute beast of a company. Full ATM machine/ print money at will. Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early. Picked some catalyst dates and picked a spread of options with varying risk)My latest and biggest gainer is Gme.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

            "I was 19 and my told me about it in March and just ignored him, I did a little trading in June and stopped I was up $200. I came back in July and yolod my life savings (10.5k) in RH.   I pussied out of every good play I had and did nothing until early august. Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.   Well, it\u2019s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD\u2019s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week. But never believed in my plays that ran no matter how many times I was proved right.   Throughout the month of august until now I have bought nothing and I\u2019m down to my last $700 cause bills raping me, everyday I tell myself I\u2019ll buy, I\u2019ll trust my gut, and fight with myself etc, and nothing changes. My parents think I have my money still and I have not spoke to any friends in months. I never thought I\u2019d let myself get this far down everyday since July 24th I wake up at 7 and watch the market until close and have done nothing but not trust my gut and it\u2019s fucked me over.   And I\u2019m at my last leg of desperation, my dealer offered to buy my car back 15-18k and I\u2019m gonna sell it. Deposit all of it in RH, turn on margin and start trading. I will either dig myself out of this hole or lose it all and Kill myself, no exceptions.",
            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).",
            "Started at the end of April this year with 2.5k and in a matter of weeks lost 1k. Managed to make it back to even but currently down 400 dollars. My best play was riding the NIO wave early on, making 400% profit on that position. I've certainly got better but still more progress to be made.",
            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",
            "Also 30 year old resident doctor, surgery resident. Started during COVID with around 4K. Lost money on every options play so staying with shares only.  Up ~250% all time.",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",
            "I started trading in high school and my first stock purchases, believe it or not, were Tesla &amp; Netflix before either reached $40.  Being a kid who didn't know anything, I sold both when I doubled my money, which was ~$6,000 to begin with.  I then took my money to the options world and lost all my gains by letting call options expire worthless because I didn't understand vega.  FFWD to the pandemic, I funded a futures account with $13.5k.  March crash sent that account to $90k in less than a month as I built up to 3 full ES contracts short.  Being full of myself, I traded like a moron until that account was back to $13k.  The emotional pain drove me to read and search for new strategies.  I spent some time in the Sosnoff camp selling options and quickly got bored.  I then read 7 books in a couple months and the one that changed me was Options Volatility &amp; Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  I began to study options pricing and learned everything I could about volatility.  I began scanning the market for low IV sector rotations and would scoop up the top 3-4 tickers by volume.  I stuck to using no more than 50% of cash, no more than 3% of acct value in one play, no less than 30 DTE and all the way up to 700DTE, and avoiding memes &amp; tech calls.  I began hitting home runs, in the last month my best call performers have been X, AA, DISCA, GE, MT, VALE, FCX, M, JWN, ABEV.",

Kept my head down until I felt secure enough to play with stocks again but not smooth brained enough for option diamond hands this year \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c. Missed PLUG, NIO, and the real JPlow printer money this year.   Got in PLTR at $20 and then again at $31. Still up 260% YTD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
            "You all have to understand that batching into positions does wonders for you. Same as what jesse Livermore stood by.  I usually take a started position for like 30_40% of what I really want, and once the confirmation is made, I'll add into it, or sell my small starter if it tricks me and breaks down. Also, i tell quick gains into bigger non volatile stocks. For example i made 22% on Tesla,  I'm not going to go throw it into PLTR cuz PLTR shares the same volatility as TSLA. so, I'll buy walmart or some other less volatile stock so that even if shit tanks, it wont tank nearly as much which means I'm protecting my profit. I  So yeah just scale into or out of your positions, also make sure you considered the true downside risk for every play, and put hot money into cold money stocks.",
            "I have two very different sides of the story, started with a Stash account September 2019, that has 5K in personal and 2K in either IRA is 62% YTD. I do not sell and buy that often there, maybe once a month. I have another 6K in Merrill since August and was doing very well until about a month ago (37% up) just trading stocks. I started playing with options a month ago and I'm down -12% YTD.  This is $ I allow myself to play and learn with, made some bad mistakes: sold JMIA 40c a day before expiration for a 40% loss and exploded the last day, was up 120% up on a SNOW put (first and only put) and got greedy and ended up selling for a 20% loss.

A couple years ago, I also started getting a 3% IRA match at work. So, with those alone, we're on track for a modest retirement.   This year, with daycare shut down, I suddenly had a bunch of extra money and decided to open a taxable account. It's mostly VTI, SPY, and UPRO, but I have been doing some meme stock trades for fun. Overall, up about 20% this year, and starting to play options a bit more.",
            "Started with $18k at 20 years old working as a line cook and going to community college as a philosophy major. Lost everything trading options. Invested my student loans and convinced my family to give me a small loan. I'm at $30k. I drop out of college. I wind up bagholding garbage weed penny stocks until I sell for a 50% loss. I go back to college. I trade to pay rent but never make a profit. Sell my car for $5500. Take out more student loans. Covid hits. I lose everything. I'm down to my last $1.9k. I don't leave my apartment for days. Shutdowns happen. I sit outside every evening to have a few beers and watch the sunset. I'm not depressed but I'm angry at myself. I don't remember what exactly set me off, but one evening I just got up and grabbed myself by the kohonas and decided that I start all over again for the umpteenth time. I swing trade travel and oil stocks for $25-$100 every day for months. My account starts getting bigger, so I'm making $100-$250 days now. I wake up at 3am and go to bed at 11pm everyday researching, planning, and watching my trades. I discover FUBO at $21. My account moons. I'm now making $300-$600 every day. I swing trade PLTR every day and my account moons again.   I'm 24 years old now and my account is sitting at $85k. I've made back everything I've ever lost and then some and average around $2.6k a day. I'm also going to into my last year of college as a Finance major.   As much as it hurts to watch dozens of WSBgods be born in this market, I realized that I don't have to make $1m overnight to be satisfied. The trick for me from the beginning was to avoid trying to hit those home runs and just take profit. Even if you're still confident in the trade. Also, play the trend. Don't try to be a top ticker. Lastly, have yourself with a couple of beers every now and then. For me, it helps my mind reset and evaluate my trading philosophy.   We're all going to make it.",
            "My story is I started trading back in late 2015 after I found robinhood. Few grand lost here and there. Took a break at 2017 after not much success. Basically trying to hit home runs, holding longer than I should have and mad fomoing. Dabbled in 2018 and 2019 didn\u2019t learn anything. Wasn\u2019t until the crash where I had a influx of cash March 2020, played a few options but mainly just bought stocks at the lows. Back in late March I was finally +% all time. Fast forward today I don\u2019t have any stocks in robinhood but just playing the long game on AAPL and small leaps on cruise lines about 25k total. up 120% this year and about 90% all time. My 5 year goal is just Apple. Suppose I can retire in 5 years if all goes well, sell my house and move to Thailand for 10 years and continue while my portfolio grows, while reducing COL by like 40-50%. Come back to America and maybe setup shop in Vegas (I love playing craps) Options is just play money for me, I don\u2019t spend much. I probably throw 30% of my income into retirement accounts.",
            "My story goes like this:     1.  Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.  (around 50kish total) By no means rich, still a small fish, but I now have enough $$$ to spread around my investments and hopefully make a lot of money in this coming up year.     **TL:DR =  Had nothing in 2016, made some trendies, have money now.**",
            "Started trading in June with 3K, SPACs only. Over the course of the next 6 months, I put in a few thousand from my check( most of my check) each month for a total of 20k year to date.

            "I've always had 150K plus in mutual funds through a traditional brokerage. Took 15K to play with, lost half buying SPY puts in March, then got scared and never invested an additional 70K I had to play with. In September I paper handed played with weed stocks. If I held I'd be up 100%. Bought back in with ARKK and ARKG and some others a few weeks back. Feel fucking dumb as a brick. However, my old school mutual funds made 30% this year, so I guess it was a success.",
            "Started looking into it in March. Started with $200 to play with and learn. Went up to maybe $500 dollars, dropped down to $300 and kind of forgot about it. Got more serious about a couple months ago and turned the $300 into 13k. So far I\u2019ve lost about 5k of the 13k lol",
            "Never make a play that will blow up your account. I like to stick to 2-3 or so tickers and let the retarrt strength of options lead to valhalla",
            "Been trading on/off since 2008. For years bought shares and held. Made all the mistakes. Chased all kinds of tickers. It is dumb unless you have a huge pot to work with. How to reduce the time to increase the pot? Now I use a system where input (income, gains) goes into options for a chance to increase considerably in a short amount of time. I try for 100%. Usually I buy 3, 6 or 12 month calls on tickers I follow closely. I only buy calls when the ticker is down. Only buy on blood red days. Only calls. I gave up trying to be smarter(puts) than everyone else years ago. Losers do that unless they are at a serious firm with millions in resources. The rest of us can\u2019t play that game.   The long duration gives me plenty of time to get out with some type of gain. After a few months if the company or market isn\u2019t buzzing I start to figure out a sale price. Usually these are like 15% gain trades.   I think a lot about what the next 3-12 months look like and then pick a trade once I feel convinced something is going to happen.   Like I am convinced Benioff talked to a lot of customers and internal data and it said buying Slack is just what his customers want. I spread 10k out across calls for next year through dec. These will be easy triples for me. I don\u2019t watch them that much until 1 month out and I almost always sell the calls a few weeks before expire. I\u2019ve lost a lot of gains in the last week or two cause of this rule, but it gives someone else plenty of upside and my risk is lowered.   Sounds boring waiting for 6 or 12 months but once you\u2019re going, each month you should have 1-3 trades ready to close and gains to recycle or bank. 6 months ago I knew video games would be massive this year, so that was my holiday focus. Felt like nothing could eff that up even the election.   Post election I waited for weed stocks to get real cheap and loaded like crazy for 1 year out. I think the right weed LEAPS will make 1000%+ gains over 12 months. Bank it.   The Bank is the ultimate goal. The big pot. I use an app based managed fund that I set to the most aggressive setting. It is up 30% on the year. Twice I have sold it and bought back in, once in early March once in mid Oct.   When I sell contracts I take 70% to Bank and 30% Input for new round of trades. Don\u2019t break this rule. Get profits to bank.   Trading account is up 230% since May at $35k. Started with $10k ,in this account. Currently have 10 trades open across TTWO, IPOC, OPEN, CRM, UPS, LLY, CCL",

Terpenes are not the \u201conly modulator in cannabis,\u201d but they definitely have an impact on the unique experience of each strain.

And during that time a lot of posts from here would pop up occasionally in popular for me as I browsed so I\u2019d lurk around confused about what it was about. The memes really drew me in though.  Learned about options and lost all of my gains. Until recently when I saw the DD post of PLTR while it was at $15. I said fuck it and deposit what I had in my savings to buy shares and leaps.  Aaaand. Now we\u2019re here. Got $2k profit so far so that\u2019s kinda cool.

I was holding NVDA at the time and some other stocks but NVDA took most of my money since i sold at a loss fearing i was never going to make my money back. Sometime in 2019 I was unemployed and started trading shares again. This time making minimal profits. Some $30 or $15. Very minuscule profits but it paid for my weed and gas. Fast forward to 2020, I jumped back into trading after a few months of having my account collect dust because I learned about options trading. Saw a few videos on youtube and said fuck it why not. Dont really know what all this gamma, vega, delta bullshit is but here goes nothing. And so far its been going better than i expected it to be.

            "Started working for a brokerage firm in 2016 with no knowledge of how anything works or what I was doing but figured I needed to have some skin in the game to talk about it appropriately. Bought a some boomer stocks that didn\u2019t really do shit over a time. Sold that and bought Tesla @ 185 pre split and sold like paper hand bitch at 260 5 months later. Fast forward to this year and I started trading options in February, beginning with SPCE and was basically day trading. Lost the majority of my account in April by being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and it\u2019s Been a slow bleed out ever since. Retirement accounts have had a few great plays suck as PLTR, NIO , DAL. Down to my final $300 in my original account, praying VALE to the moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
            "This year around a few days before the crash. I don\u2019t know if I just saw something on the news regarding said crash or what but I had this urge to want to start a portfolio.  Took about a month before I was actually approved to begin trading and put in $300 in a few Delta and AMD shares. Sold those for a minor profit.  And during that time a lot of posts from here would pop up occasionally in popular for me as I browsed so I\u2019d lurk around confused about what it was about. The memes really drew me in though.  Learned about options and lost all of my gains. Until recently when I saw the DD post of PLTR while it was at $15. I said fuck it and deposit what I had in my savings to buy shares and leaps.  Aaaand. Now we\u2019re here. Got $2k profit so far so that\u2019s kinda cool. Still holding onto those calls even though they\u2019re not as strong as that initial bull run. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 (rockets added because this is WSB after all.)",
            "I started trading the first few months after I turned 18. Signed up to RH and my first few trades were very speculative. Afterwards sometime in December of 2018 I invested my first $600 in the market and lost about $500. I was holding NVDA at the time and some other stocks but NVDA took most of my money since i sold at a loss fearing i was never going to make my money back. Sometime in 2019 I was unemployed and started trading shares again. This time making minimal profits. Some $30 or $15. Very minuscule profits but it paid for my weed and gas. Fast forward to 2020, I jumped back into trading after a few months of having my account collect dust because I learned about options trading. Saw a few videos on youtube and said fuck it why not. Dont really know what all this gamma, vega, delta bullshit is but here goes nothing. And so far its been going better than i expected it to be. I finally recouoed my $500 loss and made about 6k in total. Would have been up 12k for the year but I  bought some Tesla calls earlier this month and didnt sell at a profit because I wanted more money",
            "Started educating myself in late feb/early March after seeing a meme on Facebook about investing in travel stocks. Put 10k into the market in April trading Cineworld and made a nice 5k. Moved onto the travel sector (bringing a friend on board at this point) and we traded CCL, NCLH, DAL and AAL and I\u2019d taken my account to 25k up until June 8th. Started a horrendous losing streak because I\u2019d get scared and close my positions early all the time. I went all the way back down to 12k before we started trading NIO months ago. I\u2019m now up to 65k with 80% of my equity in shared and 20% in options. Current positions are NIO and PLTR.",

Maybe in the short term, but someone who has that knowledge makes better gains over time, knows how to scale their risk tolerance to their account, and won't loose that 100k on bad trades. Knowledge is absolutely necessary if you want to make this a living. Saying that it doesn't matter how much you know is such an ignorant outlook on how to trade and one of the reasons people on here lose so much money. For every 100k win there are thousands of losses.

            "My story goes like this:     1.  Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.

Do you want to focus on repairing and restoring a vehicle? Do you want track days? Do you want to turbo charge a car? Or maybe you just want a fun car to drive and tinker on. There is obviously a lot of overlap between these but it\u2019s worthwhile to have a rough plan first.   I\u2019ll be honest a budget of $1000 isn\u2019t much especially in today\u2019s used car markets unless you want an absolute bottom of the barrel civic or something. However if you diligently search CL / FB marketplace and set price alerts, and be first to the buyer with cash in hand you can make miracles happen.   My best project car recommendation would be this, in no particular order:   Honda Civic hatch or coupe, preferably a 1990\u2019s VTEC model because of the known fantastic motors and fun handling not to mention aftermarket support. Fun to drive and reliable, relatively easy to work on. Price on these depending on year and condition starts at below 1000 for utter beater trash and will go up from there.   1990-2004 Mazda Miata. This encompasses the first two generations of miata. Unbeatable handling and fun for the price, without debate. Best manual trans ever made in a consumer vehicle. Also unbeatable reliability and aftermarket support. Be warned though the resale value of these is going up, but right now these are still my best recommendation for a starting project car. Beater examples from the $1000-$2750 range. I can go on and on about these because they\u2019re my passion, if you want more, info let me know.   An old mustang (fox body) are cool, reliable, relatively cheap and good platforms.   5th generation corvettes (the current cheapest type of corvette) are much pricier than any of the other options I put here but they have a LEGENDARY motor and are awesome to drive. Again easy to work on and relatively cheap and reliable.    *all in all* being a car hobbyist is a money pit and a time sink. But I think it is absolutely worth it. If you buy a 1k car you could easily put 3x more into it than it\u2019s worth in a year if you wanted to, or just keep it alive with minimum maintenance and rip it around town for fun.

An old mustang (fox body) are cool, reliable, relatively cheap and good platforms.   5th generation corvettes (the current cheapest type of corvette) are much pricier than any of the other options I put here but they have a LEGENDARY motor and are awesome to drive. Again easy to work on and relatively cheap and reliable.    *all in all* being a car hobbyist is a money pit and a time sink. But I think it is absolutely worth it. If you buy a 1k car you could easily put 3x more into it than it\u2019s worth in a year if you wanted to, or just keep it alive with minimum maintenance and rip it around town for fun.

This also depends on your position - if you got in at or near NAV ($10-ish) take some profits when you see fit (50% seems like a good starting point for sure) then let the rest ride as you see fit. You should also keep in mind the reason for companies like this going public: either they need their initial investors to cash out (not the case with UWM as it was mostly funded by their revenues), OR they foresee a reduction in business coming up which will result in a need for other means of funding  (shareholders) to supplement their cash flow.

Made a rookie move back in March and sold as soon as I heard COVID was coming, didn\u2019t buy back in either (I was holding Tesla and Apple, for some reason turned bearish). Learned my lesson from that. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research/analysis and picking options without putting any actual money in them because losing a few hundred is devastating to a college student and I\u2019m not as ballsy as some of you fuckers. However, my \u201cfantasy calls/puts\u201d have been performing extremely well for a while. Might grow some balls and actually buy some contracts in \u201821.",

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes.

            "My $INO are gonna make me a millionaire mark my words",
            "So i started late 2019. I didn\u2019t know anything and didn\u2019t know if I was trading or investing. My dad told me a list of stocks but mainly played inovio. So back in march I was playing the swings on inovio. I was a stupid trader and would go all in for 2k and buy shares. I was making around $300 dollars a week with 0 risk management and had no idea how dangerously I was actually playing. When inovio ran to $30 I had 1k in shares and two separate short term calls. I was up 8k and ultimately sold for a profit of 6.3k. I then pulled out 2k to put in savings and it went downhill from there. I started taking bigger trades and messing with options. I took a 2.6k loss on inovio and lost another 2k overtime with random stupid trades. I was down to my last 1k and took a break for a long time. I started reading stock books, taking some classes, learning technical analysis and risk management strategies. I currently have 2k I\u2019m playing with and want to daytrade options until I have 10k when I will invest 50% index funds and 50% blue chip stocks. I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at :)",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD).

This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew.

They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes.

            "So i started late 2019. I didn\u2019t know anything and didn\u2019t know if I was trading or investing. My dad told me a list of stocks but mainly played inovio. So back in march I was playing the swings on inovio. I was a stupid trader and would go all in for 2k and buy shares. I was making around $300 dollars a week with 0 risk management and had no idea how dangerously I was actually playing. When inovio ran to $30 I had 1k in shares and two separate short term calls. I was up 8k and ultimately sold for a profit of 6.3k. I then pulled out 2k to put in savings and it went downhill from there. I started taking bigger trades and messing with options. I took a 2.6k loss on inovio and lost another 2k overtime with random stupid trades. I was down to my last 1k and took a break for a long time. I started reading stock books, taking some classes, learning technical analysis and risk management strategies. I currently have 2k I\u2019m playing with and want to daytrade options until I have 10k when I will invest 50% index funds and 50% blue chip stocks. I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at :)",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.

At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3.

I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

            "I got into the stock market back in mid 2019 but all I did was invest in dividend stocks. In December when I looked at my all time chart I had made about 7 bucks. Now I was subscribed to WSB for awhile because I had seen some funny memes and gains over the years and thought that was cool to see on my homepage every once in awhile. Then in Dec 2019 I decided I would figure out how they make so many gainz and discovered options. I had never known such an amazing concept existed so I got to researching everything I can on options on WSB and YouTube that whole month. I made a New Years Resolution that I was gonna start with $500 and start options trading on January 1st 2020 and make 100% return. Made some great trades on SPCE, MSFT, and SPY, I won some and lost some. Got $1150 on a TSLA trade back in Feb in about 5 min. Got my first 1000% on TLT the day the Fed announced the emergency rate cut in March with a few calls bought at .20 that turned into 10.00 in just a few days. Although I did lose a shit ton when the market dropped hard because I was in a lot of positions like, MSFT I still had cash to make some smaller plays which kept me from going under. Decided to cash out some of the money to build myself a gaming pc since it seemed to pandemic was going to last awhile and took a break from trading the last 3 months. Overall I made 10k since January so more than my new years resolution.   At first i thought I was unlucky starting out options in 2020 but you know what they say, \"hardship builds character.\" And if this was my first time trading options and still made a ton of profit (and I thought I was playing super conservatively too) then I can't wait until we get to the next bull market run to really rake in some cash. So thank you WSB for showing me the light in a tunnel I believed to be no light at all.",

Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",
            "I got into the stock market back in mid 2019 but all I did was invest in dividend stocks. In December when I looked at my all time chart I had made about 7 bucks. Now I was subscribed to WSB for awhile because I had seen some funny memes and gains over the years and thought that was cool to see on my homepage every once in awhile. Then in Dec 2019 I decided I would figure out how they make so many gainz and discovered options. I had never known such an amazing concept existed so I got to researching everything I can on options on WSB and YouTube that whole month. I made a New Years Resolution that I was gonna start with $500 and start options trading on January 1st 2020 and make 100% return. Made some great trades on SPCE, MSFT, and SPY, I won some and lost some. Got $1150 on a TSLA trade back in Feb in about 5 min. Got my first 1000% on TLT the day the Fed announced the emergency rate cut in March with a few calls bought at .20 that turned into 10.00 in just a few days. Although I did lose a shit ton when the market dropped hard because I was in a lot of positions like, MSFT I still had cash to make some smaller plays which kept me from going under. Decided to cash out some of the money to build myself a gaming pc since it seemed to pandemic was going to last awhile and took a break from trading the last 3 months. Overall I made 10k since January so more than my new years resolution.   At first i thought I was unlucky starting out options in 2020 but you know what they say, \"hardship builds character.\" And if this was my first time trading options and still made a ton of profit (and I thought I was playing super conservatively too) then I can't wait until we get to the next bull market run to really rake in some cash. So thank you WSB for showing me the light in a tunnel I believed to be no light at all.",
            "I started in October last year with $PCG being my first stock. In hindsight that was a retarded place to start investing cause it was off the back of their bankruptcy filings and my only reasoning was CA wasn't gonna let them fall. Needless to say I bought the dip all the way down to $5 and cashed out at around $17. Didn't discover options (and by extension this sub) until MSFT 200C 3/20 became a meme",
            "I saw all the TSLA, MSFT, and SPCE gains in January - February   Bought my first options (all in 4 diff stocks) on February 18th. FEB FUCKING 18TH. The literal day before the beginning of the worst crash in decades.   I could have had lotto timing with puts.   I got margin called and couldn\u2019t trade for like 3 weeks. Everything expired worthless and I finally fixed my account in like the end of March, missing easy money with puts on anything.",
            "Invested a little bit in college, mainly holding index funds and individual stocks like MSFT and AMD in my Roth IRA. But recently, I have been trading SPACs with tons of leverage. I put in 50k of my own money, borrowed 50k on a personal loan, and then doubled my buying power through margin. I made about 60k on T H C B (Microvast merger) and 90k this week on G H I V (United Mortgage) alone. I paid back the personal loan and withdrew some money for taxes. I now I have about 200k in PSTH (100k margin). Reply with what sort of motorcycle I should buy lol",

Stumbled upon this site in December from r/conspiracy as The Big Short was one of my favorite movies and over there we knew how fucked rona was gonna be before mainstream got a hold of it.   Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k. Started a TDA with 1k, still fucked up, but did better, at 5k and with a solid understanding that I\u2019m still a retard.   So, how long before I\u2019m profitable? Who knows. Can\u2019t do math. Down 13k (95%) on old account up 2k on new account. Won\u2019t take long considering new account I\u2019m heavy in the four horsemen, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME. Shares and leaps. Cheers you guys.

So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months. Can't wait to see what 2021 will bring, definitely holding everything right now (diamond hand gang).",

I bought spy calls and nio options and other weekly fds which did well before March to April where stonks went flat and I lost 3k after buying like dumb ass nio calls with no volume so there was literally no buyer for a week and a half as I watched it bleed to 0. I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays. I joined theta gang and started the wheel. Now I am proud of my portfolio and occasionally yolo on stuff like gme, steel, or other spacs which is the new cool thing into tendies.",

            "My story goes like this:     1.  Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.  (around 50kish total) By no means rich, still a small fish, but I now have enough $$$ to spread around my investments and hopefully make a lot of money in this coming up year.     **TL:DR =  Had nothing in 2016, made some trendies, have money now.**",

Lost the majority of my account in April by being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and it\u2019s Been a slow bleed out ever since. Retirement accounts have had a few great plays suck as PLTR, NIO , DAL. Down to my final $300 in my original account, praying VALE to the moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
            "I nominate myself for ROTY retard. Stumbled upon this site in December from r/conspiracy as The Big Short was one of my favorite movies and over there we knew how fucked rona was gonna be before mainstream got a hold of it.   Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k. Started a TDA with 1k, still fucked up, but did better, at 5k and with a solid understanding that I\u2019m still a retard.   So, how long before I\u2019m profitable? Who knows. Can\u2019t do math. Down 13k (95%) on old account up 2k on new account. Won\u2019t take long considering new account I\u2019m heavy in the four horsemen, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME. Shares and leaps. Cheers you guys. Happy Holidays and thanks for the 13k, and counting, tuition fee.",
            "I got lucky. Fcel, nio, plug, and tsla each got me 8k plus days. I thought I was a genius. Then I found out I wasn\u2019t. Played some memes. PLTR really hit me the hardest, late November.",
            "In Australia we were given the ability to withdraw from our superannuation, because COVID (like 401k for you in the US except it\u2019s mandatory for ur employer to pay it and you can\u2019t access until you\u2019re 65 or for a few other reasons) I withdrew the max $10,000, used half to pay of a credit card and then Yolo\u2019d the rest in to meme stocks. So far I\u2019m up a few thousand with NIO PLTR GME ASXM mainly.",
            "I got started in 2017 with beetcoin. I made a little money off of that ramp up and was hooked on the idea of trading ever since. I mostly traded crpypto and shares until this year where I started trading options. I made some dumb trades in April on OXY and was down 90% to about $200. Im back up now to 12k (thanks to NIO, TQQQ, and IPO mainly). 2021 Im either going to 120k or back to zero lol",
            "Started investing in September after talking to a friend and realizing I also wasn't going to need my down payment I had saved any time soon. Started with about 5k and soon after had put the entire 25k savings into stocks. Currently it's at about 29k, big winners were NIO, ENPH and my boy \ud83d\udc1d. I stayed away from day trading after a big fuck up with GME, which I eventually broke even on, realised I couldn't handle stress of it. I still check here and stocktwits daily just to stay in the loop, but I will rarely sell to buy something new these days.",
            "Started at the end of April this year with 2.5k and in a matter of weeks lost 1k. Managed to make it back to even but currently down 400 dollars. My best play was riding the NIO wave early on, making 400% profit on that position. I've certainly got better but still more progress to be made.",
            "I'm 20, had a lot of financial classes this academic year so I finally decided having a savings account is retarded and I need to invest. So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months. Can't wait to see what 2021 will bring, definitely holding everything right now (diamond hand gang).",
            "I started in January 2019. I had my first job out of undergrad from late 2018 and had disposable income for the first time. I really got interested in stocks after starting my 401k and then I stumbled onto options and wsb. I bought spy calls and nio options and other weekly fds which did well before March to April where stonks went flat and I lost 3k after buying like dumb ass nio calls with no volume so there was literally no buyer for a week and a half as I watched it bleed to 0. I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays. I joined theta gang and started the wheel. Now I am proud of my portfolio and occasionally yolo on stuff like gme, steel, or other spacs which is the new cool thing into tendies.",
            "It's really easy. Just know the fundamentals by looking at the YouTube videos.  Draft kings is really good since every more states are legalizing betting every year. Nio is good but id also be cautious at buying at current levels at least at a huge amount until it starts another bull run",
            "Started educating myself in late feb/early March after seeing a meme on Facebook about investing in travel stocks. Put 10k into the market in April trading Cineworld and made a nice 5k. Moved onto the travel sector (bringing a friend on board at this point) and we traded CCL, NCLH, DAL and AAL and I\u2019d taken my account to 25k up until June 8th. Started a horrendous losing streak because I\u2019d get scared and close my positions early all the time. I went all the way back down to 12k before we started trading NIO months ago. I\u2019m now up to 65k with 80% of my equity in shared and 20% in options. Current positions are NIO and PLTR.",
            "I bitched out in 2020. Held all my FAATMAN stocks that I picked up from 2016 on because stonks only go up. Had just moved across country in March and not sure if I was going to lose my job while basically broke. Kept my head down until I felt secure enough to play with stocks again but not smooth brained enough for option diamond hands this year \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c. Missed PLUG, NIO, and the real JPlow printer money this year.   Got in PLTR at $20 and then again at $31. Still up 260% YTD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
            "I don't think I'm in. I have 500$ dollars in Palantir and 280$ in FireEye. Im trying to start and I had my firsts profits buying 100$ of nio in July and selling them some days ago. Give me some tips please.",
            "My story goes like this:     1.  Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.  (around 50kish total) By no means rich, still a small fish, but I now have enough $$$ to spread around my investments and hopefully make a lot of money in this coming up year.     **TL:DR =  Had nothing in 2016, made some trendies, have money now.**",
            "Started investing after paying off student loans and car in August 2018. Went all in index fund every week after living expenses. Joined wsb in oct 2018 cus this only place where retards are treated fairly and are also glued stocks. Retardedness of wsb finally got to me last month. Sold all my index in Roth and bought 18k worth of NIO, and 5 grand of THCB. Down $600 on NIO, up $2,600 on THCB.",

Bought shares into GME between 15-17 with x5 leverage got destroyed when Q3 financial report dropped fuck Sherman lost about 30%. RC buys more shares so I decide to go all in between 17-18 and the next 2 days it blows up. I've recouped my losses and now up 2k profit thank you WSB retards I love you all. 885 shares 18.68.",

Crash in March made me realize I need to finally get into options to climb out of that fucking hole. Also made 12k playing the wheel strategy on JNUG, super underrated strategy.

The winners are the ones that are the clear leader of their group, with the least amount of risk. So for semiconductor companies, the single leader (in my opinion) is Nvidia. Why? Because the fundamentals are super solid, they have a great history of consistently beating earnings, and when you look at the future and where we are going, Nvidias GPUs and DPUs are literally powering that future. Then you look at the risks and the biggest risk is this trade war and supply chain issues. When I compare the bull case to the bear case, the bull case is a much stronger argument. That is how you identify winners. Find the best sectors, best industries, and then the best companies within them. Look at the future and what society needs and the market needs and it will naturally guide you there. I only look at technicals until I have a fully formed investment idea, technicals are just there for entries and exits.   Good way to start is sit down with a blank sheet of paper and think about what our future looks like in 5-10 years then work backwards and figure out which companies will play the biggest most important role in that future.",

Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side).

When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.

Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

Also, i tell quick gains into bigger non volatile stocks. For example i made 22% on Tesla,  I'm not going to go throw it into PLTR cuz PLTR shares the same volatility as TSLA. so, I'll buy walmart or some other less volatile stock so that even if shit tanks, it wont tank nearly as much which means I'm protecting my profit.

            "Started with $18k at 20 years old working as a line cook and going to community college as a philosophy major. Lost everything trading options. Invested my student loans and convinced my family to give me a small loan. I'm at $30k. I drop out of college. I wind up bagholding garbage weed penny stocks until I sell for a 50% loss. I go back to college. I trade to pay rent but never make a profit. Sell my car for $5500. Take out more student loans. Covid hits. I lose everything. I'm down to my last $1.9k. I don't leave my apartment for days. Shutdowns happen. I sit outside every evening to have a few beers and watch the sunset. I'm not depressed but I'm angry at myself. I don't remember what exactly set me off, but one evening I just got up and grabbed myself by the kohonas and decided that I start all over again for the umpteenth time. I swing trade travel and oil stocks for $25-$100 every day for months. My account starts getting bigger, so I'm making $100-$250 days now. I wake up at 3am and go to bed at 11pm everyday researching, planning, and watching my trades. I discover FUBO at $21. My account moons. I'm now making $300-$600 every day. I swing trade PLTR every day and my account moons again.   I'm 24 years old now and my account is sitting at $85k. I've made back everything I've ever lost and then some and average around $2.6k a day. I'm also going to into my last year of college as a Finance major.   As much as it hurts to watch dozens of WSBgods be born in this market, I realized that I don't have to make $1m overnight to be satisfied. The trick for me from the beginning was to avoid trying to hit those home runs and just take profit. Even if you're still confident in the trade. Also, play the trend. Don't try to be a top ticker. Lastly, have yourself with a couple of beers every now and then. For me, it helps my mind reset and evaluate my trading philosophy.   We're all going to make it.",
            "My story goes like this:     1.  Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.  (around 50kish total) By no means rich, still a small fish, but I now have enough $$$ to spread around my investments and hopefully make a lot of money in this coming up year.     **TL:DR =  Had nothing in 2016, made some trendies, have money now.**",

SBE is merging with Chargepoint, and if you can't figure out the value in building actual EV charging stations instead of rolling hollow trucks downhill, I don't know what to tell you.  Best case scenario, you end up with an 80% return when these expire OTM.  Worse case scenario, you end up with shares of a kickass EV stock that outperformed PLTR this year at a cost basis less than half the current price, and end up making more than 80% when those moon.

Tried to make some quick cash on AMC stimmy bump but that didn't go how I wanted. Then I put it all on a weekly GME call right before it jumped from 16 to 20. Sold after 2xing my money. GME dipped later that afternoon, bought some more GME 20c 12/31 which was out of the money, woke up next morning and it was up 150%. Didn't panic sell which I should have, it fell precipitously. Bounced up a couple times since but never as high as that morning. Still didn't sell. Currently I'm up about 20% and I feel cheated that I only made 20% in the last couple days...",

Then decided to go here in like November, \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2640\ufe0fed the PLTR wave, \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2640\ufe0fed weed stocks, and then decided to \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2640\ufe0f options via Robinhood and proceeded to destroy that account. Learned quickly that options are not a get rich quick scheme and I have to be intelligent. I wake up every morning since I\u2019m on college break and research what my plays are going to be. They profit considerably, but I usually do not make a crazy amount of money because I am \ud83e\uddfb hand. Hoping Ackman and Wood deliver me to tender town",

I went on a horrible date back in the summer where the guy was a total idiot but made a good call investing in Moderna and made a ton of money and it piqued my interest, if this idiot can make money, why can't I?  I'm not an expert at all, but this is a great distraction from work life in COVID times. I work in sales and some of my customers (oil and gas, airline, hockey teams) have also been directly impacted by COVID, falling oil prices, BLM (defunding the police) and knowing about stock goes hand in hand with knowing about the world you live in, what's happening globally and which direction the future is headed and all of this is fascinating to me. And of course, I want to make money.

The shares plays went well. Of course my max investment in any of these was $4k. Still holding them all.   Continued to have success in excess of what the market was doing, pandemic dip be damned and thought hey, what the fuck - if my own picks are beating the market, why not bet on myself?  Articles about RH and WSB piqued my interest. Made a deposit 10/1 and am 4x now. PLTR and various ARK related picks to thank.   Found my comfort zone in low risk, high reward OTM calls 6-8 months out. Current picks include GME (\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80), CDXS, RAVN, FLIR.

Stumbled upon this site in December from r/conspiracy as The Big Short was one of my favorite movies and over there we knew how fucked rona was gonna be before mainstream got a hold of it.   Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k. Started a TDA with 1k, still fucked up, but did better, at 5k and with a solid understanding that I\u2019m still a retard.   So, how long before I\u2019m profitable? Who knows. Can\u2019t do math. Down 13k (95%) on old account up 2k on new account. Won\u2019t take long considering new account I\u2019m heavy in the four horsemen, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME. Shares and leaps. Cheers you guys.

Took about a month before I was actually approved to begin trading and put in $300 in a few Delta and AMD shares. Sold those for a minor profit.  And during that time a lot of posts from here would pop up occasionally in popular for me as I browsed so I\u2019d lurk around confused about what it was about. The memes really drew me in though.  Learned about options and lost all of my gains. Until recently when I saw the DD post of PLTR while it was at $15. I said fuck it and deposit what I had in my savings to buy shares and leaps.

Fast forward to this year I find out my brother in the states (pursuing his Masters) is trading stocks on Webull. I convince him to purchase some Tesla shares pre split, at the moment those shares have doubled. I also predicted that other EV stocks such as XPEV will also blow up due to Tesla. Also prompted him on PLTR when they listed back in September. After seeing all these stocks go up I urgently needed to get my own trading account.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",
            "I'm 20, had a lot of financial classes this academic year so I finally decided having a savings account is retarded and I need to invest. So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months.

When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",

I thought I was already over diversified. Lol  I\u2019m eying the meme stock PLTR. Buying about 1,000 shares. Good idea?",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

Also, i tell quick gains into bigger non volatile stocks. For example i made 22% on Tesla,  I'm not going to go throw it into PLTR cuz PLTR shares the same volatility as TSLA. so, I'll buy walmart or some other less volatile stock so that even if shit tanks, it wont tank nearly as much which means I'm protecting my profit.

            "Started with $18k at 20 years old working as a line cook and going to community college as a philosophy major. Lost everything trading options. Invested my student loans and convinced my family to give me a small loan. I'm at $30k. I drop out of college. I wind up bagholding garbage weed penny stocks until I sell for a 50% loss. I go back to college. I trade to pay rent but never make a profit. Sell my car for $5500. Take out more student loans. Covid hits. I lose everything. I'm down to my last $1.9k. I don't leave my apartment for days. Shutdowns happen. I sit outside every evening to have a few beers and watch the sunset. I'm not depressed but I'm angry at myself. I don't remember what exactly set me off, but one evening I just got up and grabbed myself by the kohonas and decided that I start all over again for the umpteenth time. I swing trade travel and oil stocks for $25-$100 every day for months. My account starts getting bigger, so I'm making $100-$250 days now. I wake up at 3am and go to bed at 11pm everyday researching, planning, and watching my trades. I discover FUBO at $21. My account moons. I'm now making $300-$600 every day. I swing trade PLTR every day and my account moons again.   I'm 24 years old now and my account is sitting at $85k. I've made back everything I've ever lost and then some and average around $2.6k a day. I'm also going to into my last year of college as a Finance major.   As much as it hurts to watch dozens of WSBgods be born in this market, I realized that I don't have to make $1m overnight to be satisfied. The trick for me from the beginning was to avoid trying to hit those home runs and just take profit. Even if you're still confident in the trade. Also, play the trend. Don't try to be a top ticker. Lastly, have yourself with a couple of beers every now and then. For me, it helps my mind reset and evaluate my trading philosophy.   We're all going to make it.",
            "My story goes like this:     1.  Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.  (around 50kish total) By no means rich, still a small fish, but I now have enough $$$ to spread around my investments and hopefully make a lot of money in this coming up year.     **TL:DR =  Had nothing in 2016, made some trendies, have money now.**",

SBE is merging with Chargepoint, and if you can't figure out the value in building actual EV charging stations instead of rolling hollow trucks downhill, I don't know what to tell you.  Best case scenario, you end up with an 80% return when these expire OTM.  Worse case scenario, you end up with shares of a kickass EV stock that outperformed PLTR this year at a cost basis less than half the current price, and end up making more than 80% when those moon.

Years ago one of my coworkers told me about how he was saving an extra $50 per paycheck in a 401k and how when he retires he will have a nice little chunk of change in addition to his pension.   At the time I simply didn't make enough money to have enough left over to invest.    2. Changed jobs and a couple years later right at the start of 2017 I remembered my coworkers story.  I started investing in a 401k, but instead of the paltry $50 my coworker was doing, I was doing $500.    3. Also in 2017 I started buying individual stocks outside of the retirement account and bought AMD at $14 bucks and sold at $12.  I knew it was a good company but didn't understand stocks and market cap enough to see that I should have just held my shares.  I missed that rocket by a lot.    4. In 2018 and 2019 I bought and sold a few different stocks, never really holding anything longer than a few months.    5. In 2019 I tried options a few times.  I won a few earnings plays and lost a few.  Quickly realized that your weekly earning play options are essentially gambling.    6. End of 2019 I stopped doing options and started focusing on buying small to mid cap companies that I felt could grow into large cap companies in a few years.    7. Market crash happened and I started buying everything I could.  I had read up on dollar cost averaging and decided to buy all the way down and all the way up.  I've made solid returns on MGM stock and airline stock.  I also made crazy returns on NIO, PLUG, DKNG, and PLTR.    8. Dabbled in day trading options and won a few and got burned a few times.  Once again decided not to mess with options to much, or at least not in large amounts.    9. Have a decent amount of money built up between my 401k and brokerage accounts.  (around 50kish total) By no means rich, still a small fish, but I now have enough $$$ to spread around my investments and hopefully make a lot of money in this coming up year.     **TL:DR =  Had nothing in 2016, made some trendies, have money now.**",

But I do question how GME is going to do this with an industry that has \u201cdevelopers -&gt; publishers-&gt; market places -&gt; consumers\u201d.

Benjamin Graham was an Investor, so powerful and so eise he could use the Margin to influence the market to create money... He had such a knowledge of the fundamentals that he could even keep the ones he cared about from losing all their money. Actually doing research is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so rich, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his money, which eventually, of course, he did.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

            "Back in March, my mom overdosed due to all the stress going on. She had stolen medicine from a hospital, lost her job and license, got her vehicle repossessed and was a month away from the bank foreclosing the house me and her were living in. Her brain essentially turned off and I found her dead one morning due to all the antidepressants she had taken at the same time.   A month later we discovered all that, and I finally decided that I should stop blowing through money like there were no tomorrow, and start being smarter.   I moved in with my dad and started researching savings accounts(both parents were terrified of the stock market, and school never taught me the importance of investing).

            "   Started in 2017 during the peak of bitcoin bubble.  I recently gotten a a job and a friend told me about this app called Robinhood which offer no trade commissiona plus a free stock. Yay! lucky me \ud83e\udd1e Made my first $100 within the first week with only around $120 and I was hooked. Bragged to my friends about my 100% plus gainz and how I was day trading as side job. Then, the inevitable happened and lost most of it during a momentum stock trading penny stocks. Not only that I broke the PDT rule and my account was locked for for three months. After I got back I took fewer risks for fewer profit until I had an emergency and had to use withdraw all my funds to pay for the bills.  Then early 2020 happened and I was trying to save money to travel and figure hey I should try to invest so my funds grow faster. This happened in part because I saw posts of people using option to multiply their gainz 1000% plus . So I got back into it and gave this option thing a try and I started to see 100% plus again and was getting close of getting back all that I've lost in previous years. I was super thrilled about it thinking to myself that this time was going to be different and that I would make tons of tendies.    At the same time I saw news of this little ev car company headed by Elon Musk due to project its second earnings the following week. To me, electric cars sounded futuristic so I bought like one share. Things were started to look good with my options until this big virus crash happened at the end of February and had to sell my options at a loss or ended up expired. Lost tons of money again except for the one share of TSLA and which saw nice gainz and sold it for a nice profit. The virus caught the markets by surprise and people here were using puts now, particularly on SPY to make tendies. Unfortunately, I could not afford some SPY long term puts I so was forced to use weeklys. Ended up losing again. And finally went all in puts at end March to make all the money back that I've lost after seeing lots of gain porn by lots of \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b.  Friday triple witching happened and people were complaining if that hadn't closed their positionn they would had made a bank. So I went all in on puts and was telling fcitdn the the worst was yet to come and it would be a good idea to bet against the economy. On that coming Monday all my puts lost which was about $ 1,800 lost an estimate of 35% of their value on the day alone. The more I kept losing the more I read so called motivational posts saying \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 would pay off and that \ud83d\udebd \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udc50 was a pussy move. That week alone I ended losing 75% of my porfolio and the following week at I finally sold at a loss of 95%.    April happened and was ready to give up. I had additional $1,000 plus an $1,200 stimulus check that just got. I finally had over 2k which was necessary in order to to use Margin on Robinhood. Something that I wanted to do since the beginning. After all that has happened I was thinking of buying myself a nice expensive toy with all that money and quiting once again. While this was happening, I  saw that the company that made me some good profits; Tesla, was at all time lows and was starting to run up again fast. Having lots FOMO of not being able to see these prices again I poured everything that I had plus double of that with margin went all in. That's when I finally started to to regain the March loses and getting closer to get out of that loss porn hole \ud83d\udd73.    From there on, I started to do more research and came to conclusion that Tesla was undervalued and continued to put  more into it using all my margin. Needless to say my account has rocketed rocketed \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 way beyond my all time highs.

            "Started trading tesla in April of 2019. Went all in on stocks and marginned entire account. When tesla went down to 180 I got margin called and had to sell 3 stocks, I was uber driving 80 hour weeks to not get a large chunk of my account taken. Finally got a job in robotics, my career choice but the pay was shit and ubered on the on the weekend just to get a bed in a room with eight other people (bay area prices). I eventually got fired from the robotics job because of incompetence and just ubered 80 hours a week and decided to just sleep in my car instead of paying to share a room with 8 other people, mostly ghetto fuckers as well. I was pulling 3k a week as an Uber driver (80 hour weeks) and pocketing most of it as I was living in my car. I was working so hard because I wanted to save for a big surf trip. Anyway, by the time I left the us for my surf trip I had about 25k in tesla stock and cash and decided to risk it all on tesla options right before the 2020 q1 earnings review. I really didn't know how options worked and no one in my life had expierience playing the stock market but I had discovered this sub and decided to yolo my money. I did and tesla took off during earnings and I got an understanding of how options worked. Then corona hit but I was in el salvador surfing and I didn't really see the devastation and chaos that was going on in the usa and decided to roll my options into year long leaps during March of 2020 because I learned about capital gains tax if you held your options for at least a year. I decided to hold year long leaps because I had conviction that the market would realize that tesla would be the first to market with fsd and wanted to hit that period with as much leverage as possible, I had been dabbling with machine learning and ai in my robotics career and tesla was the clear answer to being first to market.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

A month later we discovered all that, and I finally decided that I should stop blowing through money like there were no tomorrow, and start being smarter.

            "   Started in 2017 during the peak of bitcoin bubble.  I recently gotten a a job and a friend told me about this app called Robinhood which offer no trade commissiona plus a free stock. Yay! lucky me \ud83e\udd1e Made my first $100 within the first week with only around $120 and I was hooked. Bragged to my friends about my 100% plus gainz and how I was day trading as side job. Then, the inevitable happened and lost most of it during a momentum stock trading penny stocks. Not only that I broke the PDT rule and my account was locked for for three months. After I got back I took fewer risks for fewer profit until I had an emergency and had to use withdraw all my funds to pay for the bills.  Then early 2020 happened and I was trying to save money to travel and figure hey I should try to invest so my funds grow faster. This happened in part because I saw posts of people using option to multiply their gainz 1000% plus . So I got back into it and gave this option thing a try and I started to see 100% plus again and was getting close of getting back all that I've lost in previous years. I was super thrilled about it thinking to myself that this time was going to be different and that I would make tons of tendies.    At the same time I saw news of this little ev car company headed by Elon Musk due to project its second earnings the following week. To me, electric cars sounded futuristic so I bought like one share. Things were started to look good with my options until this big virus crash happened at the end of February and had to sell my options at a loss or ended up expired. Lost tons of money again except for the one share of TSLA and which saw nice gainz and sold it for a nice profit. The virus caught the markets by surprise and people here were using puts now, particularly on SPY to make tendies. Unfortunately, I could not afford some SPY long term puts I so was forced to use weeklys. Ended up losing again. And finally went all in puts at end March to make all the money back that I've lost after seeing lots of gain porn by lots of \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b.  Friday triple witching happened and people were complaining if that hadn't closed their positionn they would had made a bank. So I went all in on puts and was telling fcitdn the the worst was yet to come and it would be a good idea to bet against the economy. On that coming Monday all my puts lost which was about $ 1,800 lost an estimate of 35% of their value on the day alone. The more I kept losing the more I read so called motivational posts saying \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 would pay off and that \ud83d\udebd \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udc50 was a pussy move. That week alone I ended losing 75% of my porfolio and the following week at I finally sold at a loss of 95%.    April happened and was ready to give up. I had additional $1,000 plus an $1,200 stimulus check that just got. I finally had over 2k which was necessary in order to to use Margin on Robinhood. Something that I wanted to do since the beginning. After all that has happened I was thinking of buying myself a nice expensive toy with all that money and quiting once again. While this was happening, I  saw that the company that made me some good profits; Tesla, was at all time lows and was starting to run up again fast. Having lots FOMO of not being able to see these prices again I poured everything that I had plus double of that with margin went all in. That's when I finally started to to regain the March loses and getting closer to get out of that loss porn hole \ud83d\udd73.    From there on, I started to do more research and came to conclusion that Tesla was undervalued and continued to put  more into it using all my margin. Needless to say my account has rocketed rocketed \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 way beyond my all time highs.

            "Started trading tesla in April of 2019. Went all in on stocks and marginned entire account.

Finally got a job in robotics, my career choice but the pay was shit and ubered on the on the weekend just to get a bed in a room with eight other people (bay area prices). I eventually got fired from the robotics job because of incompetence and just ubered 80 hours a week and decided to just sleep in my car instead of paying to share a room with 8 other people, mostly ghetto fuckers as well.

I really didn't know how options worked and no one in my life had expierience playing the stock market but I had discovered this sub and decided to yolo my money. I did and tesla took off during earnings and I got an understanding of how options worked. Then corona hit but I was in el salvador surfing and I didn't really see the devastation and chaos that was going on in the usa and decided to roll my options into year long leaps during March of 2020 because I learned about capital gains tax if you held your options for at least a year. I decided to hold year long leaps because I had conviction that the market would realize that tesla would be the first to market with fsd and wanted to hit that period with as much leverage as possible, I had been dabbling with machine learning and ai in my robotics career and tesla was the clear answer to being first to market.

Your option automatically executes and Monday morning you have 1000 shares of TSLA in your account that you were charged $1000 for...but in pre-market trading TSLA drops back to $700.  Your broker closes out your TSLA position at $700 within 1 hour of the married opening because you don't have $100000 in your account. You just lost $30,000.  This is called PIN loss.

Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k. Started a TDA with 1k, still fucked up, but did better, at 5k and with a solid understanding that I\u2019m still a retard.   So, how long before I\u2019m profitable? Who knows. Can\u2019t do math. Down 13k (95%) on old account up 2k on new account. Won\u2019t take long considering new account I\u2019m heavy in the four horsemen, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME. Shares and leaps. Cheers you guys. Happy Holidays and thanks for the 13k, and counting, tuition fee.",
            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

Got a job in finance in 2011, bought some individual stocks that were still undervalued here and there. Tried letting a firm manage the money but it cost too much for the value. Now I use a Vanguard ETFs but place 1-3% total portfolio value bets on individual stocks and let them run. Used FAANG for a while with solid returns. Doubled my money on Roku way back...should not have sold it at 60. In the last 5 years I'm up 125% vs sp500 96%. Only 345% Tesla gains from 10 shares.  I'm not permitted to trade options but got lucky and bought 200 shares of PLTR at $9.54 right before I started paying attention to this sub.

I pussied out of every good play I had and did nothing until early august. Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.   Well, it\u2019s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD\u2019s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week. But never believed in my plays that ran no matter how many times I was proved right.

I convince him to purchase some Tesla shares pre split, at the moment those shares have doubled. I also predicted that other EV stocks such as XPEV will also blow up due to Tesla. Also prompted him on PLTR when they listed back in September. After seeing all these stocks go up I urgently needed to get my own trading account.

            "I started trading the first few months after I turned 18. Signed up to RH and my first few trades were very speculative. Afterwards sometime in December of 2018 I invested my first $600 in the market and lost about $500. I was holding NVDA at the time and some other stocks but NVDA took most of my money since i sold at a loss fearing i was never going to make my money back. Sometime in 2019 I was unemployed and started trading shares again. This time making minimal profits. Some $30 or $15. Very minuscule profits but it paid for my weed and gas. Fast forward to 2020, I jumped back into trading after a few months of having my account collect dust because I learned about options trading. Saw a few videos on youtube and said fuck it why not. Dont really know what all this gamma, vega, delta bullshit is but here goes nothing. And so far its been going better than i expected it to be.

Then \u2019rona hit. In the summer I found WSB but was too much pussy to start gambling. Finally in november when I just got up to 5k again, I dumped my small gambling sum of $200 into tesla with 5x leverage. That shit made 600% return by 18th december.

            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with.

So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months.

Being a kid who didn't know anything, I sold both when I doubled my money, which was ~$6,000 to begin with.  I then took my money to the options world and lost all my gains by letting call options expire worthless because I didn't understand vega.  FFWD to the pandemic, I funded a futures account with $13.5k.  March crash sent that account to $90k in less than a month as I built up to 3 full ES contracts short.  Being full of myself, I traded like a moron until that account was back to $13k.  The emotional pain drove me to read and search for new strategies.  I spent some time in the Sosnoff camp selling options and quickly got bored.  I then read 7 books in a couple months and the one that changed me was Options Volatility &amp; Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  I began to study options pricing and learned everything I could about volatility.  I began scanning the market for low IV sector rotations and would scoop up the top 3-4 tickers by volume.  I stuck to using no more than 50% of cash, no more than 3% of acct value in one play, no less than 30 DTE and all the way up to 700DTE, and avoiding memes &amp; tech calls.  I began hitting home runs, in the last month my best call performers have been X, AA, DISCA, GE, MT, VALE, FCX, M, JWN, ABEV.",

My brother basically probably had some sort of a mental problem and he went full on degenerate and borrowed money on his credit cards to fund his trading accounts.... it didn't work out shocker... he actually had a good credit score too and was able to screw the banks for a good 100k plus.  So be careful with trading many people get too consumed and can go down a very dark path.  Got myself into a flipping business back in 2013 and that has made me more money than I ever though possible.  It also wasn't very time consuming so I got back into day trading in Oct 2018.   Broke even 2018 and small profit for 2019 but 2020 I am up over 200k now for the year.  Might not sound like much compared to sir jack me off but it isn't chump change.  And it also a gain not a loss which is the more typical result of day trading.  I am no expert on day trading but I have found stock selection is key to making money and trading when the odds are in your favor for your strategy. I focus on momentum and if I pick the wrong stocks I get chewed up.  Did that on Monday and Tuesday in tsla giving back over 20k to tsla after making 30k on Friday.  Luckily stopped fucking with tsla yesterday and traded baba on the news move for a 14k gain.  So now I'm only 10k off my ath for profits this year.",
            "You all have to understand that batching into positions does wonders for you. Same as what jesse Livermore stood by.  I usually take a started position for like 30_40% of what I really want, and once the confirmation is made, I'll add into it, or sell my small starter if it tricks me and breaks down. Also, i tell quick gains into bigger non volatile stocks. For example i made 22% on Tesla,  I'm not going to go throw it into PLTR cuz PLTR shares the same volatility as TSLA. so, I'll buy walmart or some other less volatile stock so that even if shit tanks, it wont tank nearly as much which means I'm protecting my profit. I  So yeah just scale into or out of your positions, also make sure you considered the true downside risk for every play, and put hot money into cold money stocks.",

You don't need to make consistent gains. Yes it's great to understand options, but the guy who got lucky is in the same position as you. He won't need to do as many trades, or trades at all last that. And no I don't think anyone should chase it, but I think the YOLO is absolutely worth it.   One of the other thing is don't buy weeklies. You can buy monthlies. And if the stock doesn't drop as much you can always sell early. No need to stay \ud83d\udc8e\u270b  I feel like you can read and understand as much as you want. But the market can be irrational. Did we think Tesla was ever gonna get here. Fuck no.

I was down, but didn't wanna be out.   That 500 is now $6500. My best moments was hitting 6-7 earning plays correctly in a row, and writing DD on it, leading me to have a following of 3000+ WSBers here on reddit.

            "I got into the stock market back in mid 2019 but all I did was invest in dividend stocks. In December when I looked at my all time chart I had made about 7 bucks. Now I was subscribed to WSB for awhile because I had seen some funny memes and gains over the years and thought that was cool to see on my homepage every once in awhile. Then in Dec 2019 I decided I would figure out how they make so many gainz and discovered options. I had never known such an amazing concept existed so I got to researching everything I can on options on WSB and YouTube that whole month. I made a New Years Resolution that I was gonna start with $500 and start options trading on January 1st 2020 and make 100% return. Made some great trades on SPCE, MSFT, and SPY, I won some and lost some. Got $1150 on a TSLA trade back in Feb in about 5 min. Got my first 1000% on TLT the day the Fed announced the emergency rate cut in March with a few calls bought at .20 that turned into 10.00 in just a few days. Although I did lose a shit ton when the market dropped hard because I was in a lot of positions like, MSFT I still had cash to make some smaller plays which kept me from going under. Decided to cash out some of the money to build myself a gaming pc since it seemed to pandemic was going to last awhile and took a break from trading the last 3 months. Overall I made 10k since January so more than my new years resolution.   At first i thought I was unlucky starting out options in 2020 but you know what they say, \"hardship builds character.\" And if this was my first time trading options and still made a ton of profit (and I thought I was playing super conservatively too) then I can't wait until we get to the next bull market run to really rake in some cash.

Only take trades that have good risk reward 3. Get conservative after big runs (the past month for example.) 4.

            "Majored in finance at a state school in California. Started day trading again in March after losing 50k in 2016 playing options.  Actually did ok up until September 1st. Got a huge distribution payout from my startup company and threw it all into rh. On September 1st - 11th I blew 70% of my account on aapl and tsla calls. Value of my port went from 63k to &lt;20k. From there I started yoloing in random things such as spce, amd, aal, docu, cvna, before taking a big drop down to 4K. I sat at 4K from October to November when I finally got a hot tip about solar. I dumped everything into CSIQ calls for December and January when it was around $38 per share. Earlier this week, CSIQ pumped around 20% thus rocketing my port back to a respectable 42k. Still need about 20k to get even but dude 63k&gt;4k&gt;42k is seriously the best Christmas present ever.

            "Up 40k on 60k principal for the year. Lurked for 1.5 years now, used to be an index only guy but I watched and learned. Started trading single stock in feb, starting with tesla. Held everything through march, didn't capitalize much on the initial rebound but I did start trading heavily after the market hit bottom. Only approved for cc's, I almost exclusively have been trading shares. My most notable profits were made from TSLA, PLTR, CRSR, MP, REGN, HYLN, CIIC, FSR, and CMPS.",

Crisper, Virgin Galactic, Cloudflare, AMD, Tesla and a 1500 dollar gain on quantumscape that I got lucky on. Sold all of my Tesla and QS and put it in Apple and ARKK.",

            "   Started in 2017 during the peak of bitcoin bubble.  I recently gotten a a job and a friend told me about this app called Robinhood which offer no trade commissiona plus a free stock. Yay! lucky me \ud83e\udd1e Made my first $100 within the first week with only around $120 and I was hooked. Bragged to my friends about my 100% plus gainz and how I was day trading as side job. Then, the inevitable happened and lost most of it during a momentum stock trading penny stocks. Not only that I broke the PDT rule and my account was locked for for three months. After I got back I took fewer risks for fewer profit until I had an emergency and had to use withdraw all my funds to pay for the bills.  Then early 2020 happened and I was trying to save money to travel and figure hey I should try to invest so my funds grow faster. This happened in part because I saw posts of people using option to multiply their gainz 1000% plus . So I got back into it and gave this option thing a try and I started to see 100% plus again and was getting close of getting back all that I've lost in previous years. I was super thrilled about it thinking to myself that this time was going to be different and that I would make tons of tendies.    At the same time I saw news of this little ev car company headed by Elon Musk due to project its second earnings the following week. To me, electric cars sounded futuristic so I bought like one share. Things were started to look good with my options until this big virus crash happened at the end of February and had to sell my options at a loss or ended up expired. Lost tons of money again except for the one share of TSLA and which saw nice gainz and sold it for a nice profit. The virus caught the markets by surprise and people here were using puts now, particularly on SPY to make tendies. Unfortunately, I could not afford some SPY long term puts I so was forced to use weeklys. Ended up losing again. And finally went all in puts at end March to make all the money back that I've lost after seeing lots of gain porn by lots of \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b.  Friday triple witching happened and people were complaining if that hadn't closed their positionn they would had made a bank. So I went all in on puts and was telling fcitdn the the worst was yet to come and it would be a good idea to bet against the economy. On that coming Monday all my puts lost which was about $ 1,800 lost an estimate of 35% of their value on the day alone. The more I kept losing the more I read so called motivational posts saying \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 would pay off and that \ud83d\udebd \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udc50 was a pussy move. That week alone I ended losing 75% of my porfolio and the following week at I finally sold at a loss of 95%.    April happened and was ready to give up. I had additional $1,000 plus an $1,200 stimulus check that just got. I finally had over 2k which was necessary in order to to use Margin on Robinhood. Something that I wanted to do since the beginning. After all that has happened I was thinking of buying myself a nice expensive toy with all that money and quiting once again. While this was happening, I  saw that the company that made me some good profits; Tesla, was at all time lows and was starting to run up again fast. Having lots FOMO of not being able to see these prices again I poured everything that I had plus double of that with margin went all in. That's when I finally started to to regain the March loses and getting closer to get out of that loss porn hole \ud83d\udd73.    From there on, I started to do more research and came to conclusion that Tesla was undervalued and continued to put  more into it using all my margin. Needless to say my account has rocketed rocketed \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 way beyond my all time highs. These big loses made me not to options Yolo again atd became very weary of advice given here.",

            "Started trading tesla in April of 2019. Went all in on stocks and marginned entire account. When tesla went down to 180 I got margin called and had to sell 3 stocks, I was uber driving 80 hour weeks to not get a large chunk of my account taken. Finally got a job in robotics, my career choice but the pay was shit and ubered on the on the weekend just to get a bed in a room with eight other people (bay area prices). I eventually got fired from the robotics job because of incompetence and just ubered 80 hours a week and decided to just sleep in my car instead of paying to share a room with 8 other people, mostly ghetto fuckers as well. I was pulling 3k a week as an Uber driver (80 hour weeks) and pocketing most of it as I was living in my car. I was working so hard because I wanted to save for a big surf trip. Anyway, by the time I left the us for my surf trip I had about 25k in tesla stock and cash and decided to risk it all on tesla options right before the 2020 q1 earnings review. I really didn't know how options worked and no one in my life had expierience playing the stock market but I had discovered this sub and decided to yolo my money. I did and tesla took off during earnings and I got an understanding of how options worked. Then corona hit but I was in el salvador surfing and I didn't really see the devastation and chaos that was going on in the usa and decided to roll my options into year long leaps during March of 2020 because I learned about capital gains tax if you held your options for at least a year. I decided to hold year long leaps because I had conviction that the market would realize that tesla would be the first to market with fsd and wanted to hit that period with as much leverage as possible, I had been dabbling with machine learning and ai in my robotics career and tesla was the clear answer to being first to market. Those year long leaps that I have been holding have gone from 20k to being worth 1.9 million usd today.",

Also as an employee I'd rather get 5 $400 stocks than 1 $2000, as it is easier to liquify.  And he did say: \"Tesla stock prize to high imo\".

This is why I agree with you that price could still keep going up despite how counter intuitive it \"should\" be, but also why I still stand by my stance that TSLA investors at this point in time are simply investing in a greater fool model (I like elon and TSLA, and expect a massive stock correction followed by a healthy long term growth over the decade).",

            "Please God, I want to impregnate Elon Musk so bad. I want him to bear my children with those beautiful child-bearing hips. That beautiful, radiant angel. Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins.  Elon Musk is beyond divine. I can't help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see his beautiful figure even though it's behind that unnecessary gym clothes. I yearn for him in a way both Primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweet, glistening sweat from his smooth, creamy skin. I want to listen to his moans as my manhood throbs within him, I want to hear his heart race as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union.  I want to suckle at his fatherly bosom, slurping that rich juche milk from his teat as he gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir his velvety cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. His cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to him until my body gave out, and then some. I would let him break my rib cage with any part of his body. I would let him hit me with his TSLA just to be near him for a brief moment.  He's so perfect it hurts. Every moment without him I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot sauce forced through every orifice of my body. I want him, I need him. I want to desecrate his crisp general suit. I want to start a family with him and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out. I want to see those luscious lips speak such filthy, perverse words into my ear while he slides ice cubes down my gaping pisshole.  I want to fuck him like he owes me money. I would let him step on me, just to feel the soft, firm warmth of his feet upon my face and groin area. I would sleep under him just to catch his drool in my mouth. I would fish the strands of hair from his shower drain just to smell his alluring scent, and braid them into necklaces to keep him with me always. Or cock rings. Whichever would please him more.  God please, I would do anything for him. I would relinquish my life, all my hopes and dreams, just to become the socks on his feet so that I may warm his mouthwatering toes with my very being, so that he may feel the heat of my love always. I would encase myself in cement and become his doorstep, so that he may wipe his heels upon my face. I would tear my own limbs off. I don't know what l'd do after that, or why he might want my limbs. But I would do it.  My queen, my goddess, the light of my life. Please God, let me have him. I want him to be mine and only mine. I would lick the Doritos dust from his fingers and fill his belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give him a sponge-bath with my tongue every morning and serve him breakfast in bed. I would let him eat his eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased him, no matter how painful the third-degree burns would be.  I would bear the torment of eternal damnation until the end of time to taste the seat of his TSLA but once. There is nothing I wouldn't do for him, nothing wouldn't say. I would beat my own friend to death with my engorged penis if it would bring a smile to Elon Musk\u2019s shining face. I wouldn't even let myself Cum until he gave me permission.  I love you, Elon Musk. Please. Be mine. Be my wife, my Lover, my mommy, my everything. Say yes. Answer my calls, respond to my letters. Something. Give me a sign, Elon. I'm waiting for you.  I\u2019ll always be waiting for you.",

Maybe they have skills Milton didn't have, but they teamed up with Milton because they wanted to ride the hype to stock gains.

I got in June and July at 4$ and just loved all the catalysts that would come for them in the fall with console cycle. Nothing I\u2019ve put money in has come from wsb. It\u2019s definitely important to do your own research/ have a plan/ and believe in what you\u2019re investing in. It\u2019s helped me hold through tough times.",

Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account.

At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side).

Being full of myself, I traded like a moron until that account was back to $13k.  The emotional pain drove me to read and search for new strategies.  I spent some time in the Sosnoff camp selling options and quickly got bored.  I then read 7 books in a couple months and the one that changed me was Options Volatility &amp; Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  I began to study options pricing and learned everything I could about volatility.  I began scanning the market for low IV sector rotations and would scoop up the top 3-4 tickers by volume.  I stuck to using no more than 50% of cash, no more than 3% of acct value in one play, no less than 30 DTE and all the way up to 700DTE, and avoiding memes &amp; tech calls.

My brother basically probably had some sort of a mental problem and he went full on degenerate and borrowed money on his credit cards to fund his trading accounts.... it didn't work out shocker... he actually had a good credit score too and was able to screw the banks for a good 100k plus.  So be careful with trading many people get too consumed and can go down a very dark path.  Got myself into a flipping business back in 2013 and that has made me more money than I ever though possible.  It also wasn't very time consuming so I got back into day trading in Oct 2018.   Broke even 2018 and small profit for 2019 but 2020 I am up over 200k now for the year.  Might not sound like much compared to sir jack me off but it isn't chump change.  And it also a gain not a loss which is the more typical result of day trading.  I am no expert on day trading but I have found stock selection is key to making money and trading when the odds are in your favor for your strategy. I focus on momentum and if I pick the wrong stocks I get chewed up.  Did that on Monday and Tuesday in tsla giving back over 20k to tsla after making 30k on Friday.  Luckily stopped fucking with tsla yesterday and traded baba on the news move for a 14k gain.  So now I'm only 10k off my ath for profits this year.",
            "You all have to understand that batching into positions does wonders for you. Same as what jesse Livermore stood by.  I usually take a started position for like 30_40% of what I really want, and once the confirmation is made, I'll add into it, or sell my small starter if it tricks me and breaks down. Also, i tell quick gains into bigger non volatile stocks. For example i made 22% on Tesla,  I'm not going to go throw it into PLTR cuz PLTR shares the same volatility as TSLA. so, I'll buy walmart or some other less volatile stock so that even if shit tanks, it wont tank nearly as much which means I'm protecting my profit. I  So yeah just scale into or out of your positions, also make sure you considered the true downside risk for every play, and put hot money into cold money stocks.",
            "True I agree with you, especially in the Mentality that we gain. But imagine one person that makes that 100k off of one trade. Is it hard? Ofc. But I don't think it's impossible. You don't need to make consistent gains. Yes it's great to understand options, but the guy who got lucky is in the same position as you. He won't need to do as many trades, or trades at all last that. And no I don't think anyone should chase it, but I think the YOLO is absolutely worth it.   One of the other thing is don't buy weeklies. You can buy monthlies. And if the stock doesn't drop as much you can always sell early. No need to stay \ud83d\udc8e\u270b  I feel like you can read and understand as much as you want. But the market can be irrational. Did we think Tesla was ever gonna get here. Fuck no. It's not even understandable.   Just personally, I think it doesn't matter how much you know.",
            "I heard about tesla and wanted to get in on the stock market because it was making people money. I made an account sometime in February and put in $1000. Unforutnelty, I didn't just buy TSLA and hold but I learned options and did earning plays. Failed at each one, losing all my money in a week. Just for kicks, I put in $500 more. I was down, but didn't wanna be out.   That 500 is now $6500. My best moments was hitting 6-7 earning plays correctly in a row, and writing DD on it, leading me to have a following of 3000+ WSBers here on reddit. Gay mods banned me tho, so I made a new account (this one) and quit posting DD.   P.S. why are these random threads sticked? I thought the 2nd sticky was for DD posts.",

            "I got into the stock market back in mid 2019 but all I did was invest in dividend stocks. In December when I looked at my all time chart I had made about 7 bucks. Now I was subscribed to WSB for awhile because I had seen some funny memes and gains over the years and thought that was cool to see on my homepage every once in awhile. Then in Dec 2019 I decided I would figure out how they make so many gainz and discovered options. I had never known such an amazing concept existed so I got to researching everything I can on options on WSB and YouTube that whole month. I made a New Years Resolution that I was gonna start with $500 and start options trading on January 1st 2020 and make 100% return. Made some great trades on SPCE, MSFT, and SPY, I won some and lost some. Got $1150 on a TSLA trade back in Feb in about 5 min. Got my first 1000% on TLT the day the Fed announced the emergency rate cut in March with a few calls bought at .20 that turned into 10.00 in just a few days. Although I did lose a shit ton when the market dropped hard because I was in a lot of positions like, MSFT I still had cash to make some smaller plays which kept me from going under. Decided to cash out some of the money to build myself a gaming pc since it seemed to pandemic was going to last awhile and took a break from trading the last 3 months. Overall I made 10k since January so more than my new years resolution.   At first i thought I was unlucky starting out options in 2020 but you know what they say, \"hardship builds character.\" And if this was my first time trading options and still made a ton of profit (and I thought I was playing super conservatively too) then I can't wait until we get to the next bull market run to really rake in some cash. So thank you WSB for showing me the light in a tunnel I believed to be no light at all.",

            "Started In 2012 by opening a Roth IRA and putting $500 into vanguard each month. By 2013 realized vanguard was kinda gay and started trading stocks at scottrade.  2017: made enough money to buy a house. After I withdrew the money for the house I blew up the rest of my account on xiv.  2018: inherited a little money (10k nothing crazy) and went all In on tech in the Christmas crash.  2020: all the stuff I bought in 2018 (sq roku shop) went to fucking Pluto. My parents saw how much I made and asked me to do their money. Learned how to do options so I could do covered calls for their retirement. Trade debit spreads on Tesla and other high iv stocks for myself. Lifetime stock gains almost 500k  Lessons learned: 1. Avoid earnings except on long term holds 2. Only take trades that have good risk reward 3. Get conservative after big runs (the past month for example.) 4. Buy and holding tech stocks has the best returns but is also way harder than it looks (sq going from 100-35 then to 240 this year.)",

Then I worked the entire summer(I'm 17) and have been putting literally everything I have since August into TSLA, and ended up with 50% gain and sold it all.

I dumped everything into CSIQ calls for December and January when it was around $38 per share. Earlier this week, CSIQ pumped around 20% thus rocketing my port back to a respectable 42k.

            "   Started in 2017 during the peak of bitcoin bubble.  I recently gotten a a job and a friend told me about this app called Robinhood which offer no trade commissiona plus a free stock. Yay! lucky me \ud83e\udd1e Made my first $100 within the first week with only around $120 and I was hooked. Bragged to my friends about my 100% plus gainz and how I was day trading as side job. Then, the inevitable happened and lost most of it during a momentum stock trading penny stocks. Not only that I broke the PDT rule and my account was locked for for three months. After I got back I took fewer risks for fewer profit until I had an emergency and had to use withdraw all my funds to pay for the bills.  Then early 2020 happened and I was trying to save money to travel and figure hey I should try to invest so my funds grow faster. This happened in part because I saw posts of people using option to multiply their gainz 1000% plus . So I got back into it and gave this option thing a try and I started to see 100% plus again and was getting close of getting back all that I've lost in previous years. I was super thrilled about it thinking to myself that this time was going to be different and that I would make tons of tendies.    At the same time I saw news of this little ev car company headed by Elon Musk due to project its second earnings the following week. To me, electric cars sounded futuristic so I bought like one share. Things were started to look good with my options until this big virus crash happened at the end of February and had to sell my options at a loss or ended up expired. Lost tons of money again except for the one share of TSLA and which saw nice gainz and sold it for a nice profit. The virus caught the markets by surprise and people here were using puts now, particularly on SPY to make tendies. Unfortunately, I could not afford some SPY long term puts I so was forced to use weeklys. Ended up losing again. And finally went all in puts at end March to make all the money back that I've lost after seeing lots of gain porn by lots of \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b.  Friday triple witching happened and people were complaining if that hadn't closed their positionn they would had made a bank. So I went all in on puts and was telling fcitdn the the worst was yet to come and it would be a good idea to bet against the economy. On that coming Monday all my puts lost which was about $ 1,800 lost an estimate of 35% of their value on the day alone. The more I kept losing the more I read so called motivational posts saying \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 would pay off and that \ud83d\udebd \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udc50 was a pussy move. That week alone I ended losing 75% of my porfolio and the following week at I finally sold at a loss of 95%.    April happened and was ready to give up. I had additional $1,000 plus an $1,200 stimulus check that just got. I finally had over 2k which was necessary in order to to use Margin on Robinhood. Something that I wanted to do since the beginning. After all that has happened I was thinking of buying myself a nice expensive toy with all that money and quiting once again. While this was happening, I  saw that the company that made me some good profits; Tesla, was at all time lows and was starting to run up again fast. Having lots FOMO of not being able to see these prices again I poured everything that I had plus double of that with margin went all in. That's when I finally started to to regain the March loses and getting closer to get out of that loss porn hole \ud83d\udd73.    From there on, I started to do more research and came to conclusion that Tesla was undervalued and continued to put  more into it using all my margin. Needless to say my account has rocketed rocketed \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 way beyond my all time highs.

Finally got a job in robotics, my career choice but the pay was shit and ubered on the on the weekend just to get a bed in a room with eight other people (bay area prices). I eventually got fired from the robotics job because of incompetence and just ubered 80 hours a week and decided to just sleep in my car instead of paying to share a room with 8 other people, mostly ghetto fuckers as well. I was pulling 3k a week as an Uber driver (80 hour weeks) and pocketing most of it as I was living in my car. I was working so hard because I wanted to save for a big surf trip. Anyway, by the time I left the us for my surf trip I had about 25k in tesla stock and cash and decided to risk it all on tesla options right before the 2020 q1 earnings review. I really didn't know how options worked and no one in my life had expierience playing the stock market but I had discovered this sub and decided to yolo my money. I did and tesla took off during earnings and I got an understanding of how options worked. Then corona hit but I was in el salvador surfing and I didn't really see the devastation and chaos that was going on in the usa and decided to roll my options into year long leaps during March of 2020 because I learned about capital gains tax if you held your options for at least a year. I decided to hold year long leaps because I had conviction that the market would realize that tesla would be the first to market with fsd and wanted to hit that period with as much leverage as possible, I had been dabbling with machine learning and ai in my robotics career and tesla was the clear answer to being first to market.

The difference between TSLA and any other company with just as many easy to spin narratives is that TSLA translates their narrative/sentiment into price increases like non other, and those price increases go into hyper drive (or did) with insane OTM call options.     This is why I agree with you that price could still keep going up despite how counter intuitive it \"should\" be, but also why I still stand by my stance that TSLA investors at this point in time are simply investing in a greater fool model (I like elon and TSLA, and expect a massive stock correction followed by a healthy long term growth over the decade).",

            "Please God, I want to impregnate Elon Musk so bad. I want him to bear my children with those beautiful child-bearing hips. That beautiful, radiant angel. Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins.  Elon Musk is beyond divine. I can't help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see his beautiful figure even though it's behind that unnecessary gym clothes. I yearn for him in a way both Primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweet, glistening sweat from his smooth, creamy skin. I want to listen to his moans as my manhood throbs within him, I want to hear his heart race as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union.  I want to suckle at his fatherly bosom, slurping that rich juche milk from his teat as he gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir his velvety cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. His cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to him until my body gave out, and then some. I would let him break my rib cage with any part of his body. I would let him hit me with his TSLA just to be near him for a brief moment.  He's so perfect it hurts. Every moment without him I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot sauce forced through every orifice of my body. I want him, I need him. I want to desecrate his crisp general suit. I want to start a family with him and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out. I want to see those luscious lips speak such filthy, perverse words into my ear while he slides ice cubes down my gaping pisshole.  I want to fuck him like he owes me money. I would let him step on me, just to feel the soft, firm warmth of his feet upon my face and groin area. I would sleep under him just to catch his drool in my mouth. I would fish the strands of hair from his shower drain just to smell his alluring scent, and braid them into necklaces to keep him with me always. Or cock rings. Whichever would please him more.  God please, I would do anything for him. I would relinquish my life, all my hopes and dreams, just to become the socks on his feet so that I may warm his mouthwatering toes with my very being, so that he may feel the heat of my love always. I would encase myself in cement and become his doorstep, so that he may wipe his heels upon my face. I would tear my own limbs off. I don't know what l'd do after that, or why he might want my limbs. But I would do it.  My queen, my goddess, the light of my life. Please God, let me have him. I want him to be mine and only mine. I would lick the Doritos dust from his fingers and fill his belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give him a sponge-bath with my tongue every morning and serve him breakfast in bed. I would let him eat his eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased him, no matter how painful the third-degree burns would be.  I would bear the torment of eternal damnation until the end of time to taste the seat of his TSLA but once. There is nothing I wouldn't do for him, nothing wouldn't say. I would beat my own friend to death with my engorged penis if it would bring a smile to Elon Musk\u2019s shining face. I wouldn't even let myself Cum until he gave me permission.  I love you, Elon Musk. Please. Be mine. Be my wife, my Lover, my mommy, my everything. Say yes. Answer my calls, respond to my letters. Something. Give me a sign, Elon. I'm waiting for you.  I\u2019ll always be waiting for you.",

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

I mostly avoided growth/tech stocks on my first go-round over the summer, so learning to identify what makes them tick was key (i.e. what is good revenue growth, price to sales, IP/brand moat, etc.).  Go on twitter and follow PoundingDaTable, MrZachMorris, Ripster, Luosheng Peng, Cathie's Ark, Keubiko, Brolin Walters, TicTocTick, Puru Saxena, Masa Son Cap, Post_Market and start following the follows of the last three. Not necessarily for stock picks but to better understand the mindset of market participants (and sometimes for stock picks). Even watching Cramer is good, for occasional insights on what drives buying when (e.g. the segment he did on how late in the year he would tell his hedge fund analysts to find the \"up stocks\". This lead me to start to think what successful hedgies would consider \"up stocks\" or what they would want to load up on for 2021. It's been pretty fruitful). Listen to Pounding The Table podcast. Consider buying order flow apps yourself like FlowAlgo and BlackBoxStocks. CHeck out Barchart.com for historical and current option activity. Check out fintel for institutional ownership. Etc. Over time you get a routine and a feel for what info to look at when.  Also there's a lot of good strategies people are listing here, like the guy that all-ins his account on equity in high-conviction plays, all the work he does for that. A lot to learn still, there's more I could be doing to be a better trader. Same applies to all of us",

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

I mostly avoided growth/tech stocks on my first go-round over the summer, so learning to identify what makes them tick was key (i.e. what is good revenue growth, price to sales, IP/brand moat, etc.).  Go on twitter and follow PoundingDaTable, MrZachMorris, Ripster, Luosheng Peng, Cathie's Ark, Keubiko, Brolin Walters, TicTocTick, Puru Saxena, Masa Son Cap, Post_Market and start following the follows of the last three. Not necessarily for stock picks but to better understand the mindset of market participants (and sometimes for stock picks). Even watching Cramer is good, for occasional insights on what drives buying when (e.g. the segment he did on how late in the year he would tell his hedge fund analysts to find the \"up stocks\". This lead me to start to think what successful hedgies would consider \"up stocks\" or what they would want to load up on for 2021. It's been pretty fruitful). Listen to Pounding The Table podcast. Consider buying order flow apps yourself like FlowAlgo and BlackBoxStocks. CHeck out Barchart.com for historical and current option activity. Check out fintel for institutional ownership. Etc. Over time you get a routine and a feel for what info to look at when.  Also there's a lot of good strategies people are listing here, like the guy that all-ins his account on equity in high-conviction plays, all the work he does for that. A lot to learn still, there's more I could be doing to be a better trader. Same applies to all of us",

Now I was subscribed to WSB for awhile because I had seen some funny memes and gains over the years and thought that was cool to see on my homepage every once in awhile. Then in Dec 2019 I decided I would figure out how they make so many gainz and discovered options. I had never known such an amazing concept existed so I got to researching everything I can on options on WSB and YouTube that whole month. I made a New Years Resolution that I was gonna start with $500 and start options trading on January 1st 2020 and make 100% return. Made some great trades on SPCE, MSFT, and SPY, I won some and lost some. Got $1150 on a TSLA trade back in Feb in about 5 min. Got my first 1000% on TLT the day the Fed announced the emergency rate cut in March with a few calls bought at .20 that turned into 10.00 in just a few days. Although I did lose a shit ton when the market dropped hard because I was in a lot of positions like, MSFT I still had cash to make some smaller plays which kept me from going under. Decided to cash out some of the money to build myself a gaming pc since it seemed to pandemic was going to last awhile and took a break from trading the last 3 months. Overall I made 10k since January so more than my new years resolution.   At first i thought I was unlucky starting out options in 2020 but you know what they say, \"hardship builds character.\" And if this was my first time trading options and still made a ton of profit (and I thought I was playing super conservatively too) then I can't wait until we get to the next bull market run to really rake in some cash. So thank you WSB for showing me the light in a tunnel I believed to be no light at all.",

The literal day before the beginning of the worst crash in decades.   I could have had lotto timing with puts.   I got margin called and couldn\u2019t trade for like 3 weeks.

Got a huge distribution payout from my startup company and threw it all into rh. On September 1st - 11th I blew 70% of my account on aapl and tsla calls. Value of my port went from 63k to &lt;20k. From there I started yoloing in random things such as spce, amd, aal, docu, cvna, before taking a big drop down to 4K. I sat at 4K from October to November when I finally got a hot tip about solar. I dumped everything into CSIQ calls for December and January when it was around $38 per share. Earlier this week, CSIQ pumped around 20% thus rocketing my port back to a respectable 42k. Still need about 20k to get even but dude 63k&gt;4k&gt;42k is seriously the best Christmas present ever.

Felt depressed as AF that week and bought more spy puts and got back to 55k   withdrew 20k to lock in gains   Separate variation and WSB told me to diamond hands spy 200p back to 12k and then i had to cut my losses   Failed a couple of earnings plays (PRPL) down to 4k   bought in NIO PLTR GME and Steel meme back at 30k",
            "Started in March out of boredom and no sports to gamble on. Put 100k in account and dabbled a bit with stocks only. Modest gains until August when I started trading options. Had a steady rise since then. My wife thinks I\u2019ve lost my mind but I\u2019ve turned 100k into 250k in 10 months. Got in early on some stocks:  PLTR... 1k shares at $10 another 1k at $9 and finally 1.25k at $18 ZM at $295 QS at $35.35 LAZR at $10.38 SPCE at $17 GOEV at $11  I\u2019m full blown addicted now to trading and am truly scared for what a normal market might look like.",
            "Started working for a brokerage firm in 2016 with no knowledge of how anything works or what I was doing but figured I needed to have some skin in the game to talk about it appropriately. Bought a some boomer stocks that didn\u2019t really do shit over a time. Sold that and bought Tesla @ 185 pre split and sold like paper hand bitch at 260 5 months later. Fast forward to this year and I started trading options in February, beginning with SPCE and was basically day trading. Lost the majority of my account in April by being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and it\u2019s Been a slow bleed out ever since. Retirement accounts have had a few great plays suck as PLTR, NIO , DAL. Down to my final $300 in my original account, praying VALE to the moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
            "I got into the stock market back in mid 2019 but all I did was invest in dividend stocks. In December when I looked at my all time chart I had made about 7 bucks. Now I was subscribed to WSB for awhile because I had seen some funny memes and gains over the years and thought that was cool to see on my homepage every once in awhile. Then in Dec 2019 I decided I would figure out how they make so many gainz and discovered options. I had never known such an amazing concept existed so I got to researching everything I can on options on WSB and YouTube that whole month. I made a New Years Resolution that I was gonna start with $500 and start options trading on January 1st 2020 and make 100% return. Made some great trades on SPCE, MSFT, and SPY, I won some and lost some. Got $1150 on a TSLA trade back in Feb in about 5 min. Got my first 1000% on TLT the day the Fed announced the emergency rate cut in March with a few calls bought at .20 that turned into 10.00 in just a few days. Although I did lose a shit ton when the market dropped hard because I was in a lot of positions like, MSFT I still had cash to make some smaller plays which kept me from going under. Decided to cash out some of the money to build myself a gaming pc since it seemed to pandemic was going to last awhile and took a break from trading the last 3 months. Overall I made 10k since January so more than my new years resolution.   At first i thought I was unlucky starting out options in 2020 but you know what they say, \"hardship builds character.\" And if this was my first time trading options and still made a ton of profit (and I thought I was playing super conservatively too) then I can't wait until we get to the next bull market run to really rake in some cash. So thank you WSB for showing me the light in a tunnel I believed to be no light at all.",
            "I saw all the TSLA, MSFT, and SPCE gains in January - February   Bought my first options (all in 4 diff stocks) on February 18th. FEB FUCKING 18TH. The literal day before the beginning of the worst crash in decades.   I could have had lotto timing with puts.   I got margin called and couldn\u2019t trade for like 3 weeks. Everything expired worthless and I finally fixed my account in like the end of March, missing easy money with puts on anything.",
            "Majored in finance at a state school in California. Started day trading again in March after losing 50k in 2016 playing options.  Actually did ok up until September 1st. Got a huge distribution payout from my startup company and threw it all into rh. On September 1st - 11th I blew 70% of my account on aapl and tsla calls. Value of my port went from 63k to &lt;20k. From there I started yoloing in random things such as spce, amd, aal, docu, cvna, before taking a big drop down to 4K. I sat at 4K from October to November when I finally got a hot tip about solar. I dumped everything into CSIQ calls for December and January when it was around $38 per share. Earlier this week, CSIQ pumped around 20% thus rocketing my port back to a respectable 42k. Still need about 20k to get even but dude 63k&gt;4k&gt;42k is seriously the best Christmas present ever.   Also I\u2019m a degenerate gambler in general so this community is like family for me\ud83d\ude1b",
            "Started trading in December 2019, had around 1,000 dollars in, grew it about 60%, decided to toss another 9K in, bought 6000 worth of Tesla before joining the Air Force, got out of basic training and somehow still had money after buying 3 shares at 2,000 dollars. 2 months later I'm up 70% on 10K - pretty much a held stocks, not many options. Crisper, Virgin Galactic, Cloudflare, AMD, Tesla and a 1500 dollar gain on quantumscape that I got lucky on. Sold all of my Tesla and QS and put it in Apple and ARKK.",

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",
            "Anybody else kinda happy automod ate their long DD that wouldn't have worked out? I mean, I was mostly right, but the long plays would be bleeding out now and my inbox would be getting spammed by trolls. RE: WKHS and RIDE."

Had a steady rise since then. My wife thinks I\u2019ve lost my mind but I\u2019ve turned 100k into 250k in 10 months. Got in early on some stocks:  PLTR... 1k shares at $10 another 1k at $9 and finally 1.25k at $18 ZM at $295 QS at $35.35 LAZR at $10.38 SPCE at $17 GOEV at $11  I\u2019m full blown addicted now to trading and am truly scared for what a normal market might look like.",
            "Sold TSLA at 235. Sold NVDIA at 208. Sold Zoom at 143.",
            "Started with about ~4K in July. Was buying mostly shares, and made around $1000 just off of 5 zoom shares after they smashed earnings in August. Got cucked by the September correction (literally the day after I first started playing options.) got into nio at $18 but sold when it dipped to $16 and switched to puts \ud83e\udd21at my lowest point I was down over 50%. Now I\u2019m only down 25% , mostly holding leaps and selling vertical spreads.",
            "Started with 3k in June, turned it into 7.5k during the AAPL bull run. Marked as PDT on RH after that. Made 11.5k on a ZM earning yolo. Switched to TD Ameritrade and a Webull Cash account. Had to take my tendies out of the market and started my TD account with 3k and Webull with 1k. More than Tripled both accounts on NIO, LAZR,PLTR,GME,CRSP,TSLA,CRSR,BLNK,NNMD,",
            "I feel like 2021 will be boring compared to this year. It wasn't just Tesla this year. ROKU, SE, ZM, PTON, FSLY, NET, TWLO, NIO, etc. some crazy moves across the board.",
            "Realized citron just says the stock is bad.  Then on fintel it says they buy that huge dip. Every time....nvidia, pltr, Tesla, and zoom Lol. Should be a illegal but whatev lol.",
            "P/E at 2k+ now I believe lmao worse than Zoom.  But sometimes P/E ratio reflects premium value as perceived by market participants.",
            "I told everyone to get FNGU, tech, zoom, COVID stocks in Jan/feb 2020 and everyone laughed at me. This year it\u2019s any legit Chinese stock and gambling, genetic therapy, fin tech. I made a shit load this year and I will this year too. Do with that info what you will my friend. Don\u2019t listen to bears they always lose"
