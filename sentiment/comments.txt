In doing so, they are arguably being negligent in the safeguarding of their citizens' health by pushing a vaccine out the door that may not work, and may have unexpected health issues. This would not only be problematic in terms of the direct health impact of an unsuitable vaccine, but would also severely damage public trust in vaccines and therapeutics deemed safe and effective by the Russian government. Such a failure would also likely send international shockwaves both in the markets and in terms of public trust in vaccines (covid vaccines and in general).\n\nAlso, drugs are not given approval in the US if another government approves them in their own country; it has to go through the US regulatory process.

From a technical standpoint, we are just as far along as Russia; products designed, manufacturing process designed, product manufacturing well under way.\n\nOnly reason Russia 'crossed the finish line' first is because they condensed and relaxed the regulatory process (especially clinical testing) to the extreme. In doing so, they are arguably being negligent in the safeguarding of their citizens' health by pushing a vaccine out the door that may not work, and may have unexpected health issues. This would not only be problematic in terms of the direct health impact of an unsuitable vaccine, but would also severely damage public trust in vaccines and therapeutics deemed safe and effective by the Russian government. Such a failure would also likely send international shockwaves both in the markets and in terms of public trust in vaccines (covid vaccines and in general).\n\nAlso, drugs are not given approval in the US if another government approves them in their own country; it has to go through the US regulatory process (meaning clinical testing will have to be done here).

The auction is $10 billion larger than when the U.S. Treasury first started increased the size of their debt sales back in April to finance the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs part of the concession process, traders will temporarily push yields higher to make them more attractive at purchase ahead of the auction.\n\nThe department will auction $48 billion in 3-year notes on Aug. 11 and $38 billion in 10-year notes on Aug. 12. They government will also sell $26 billion in 30-year bonds on Aug. 13. The department also announced a $6 billion increase to the auction sizes of the 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year note this quarter.

They government will also sell $26 billion in 30-year bonds on Aug. 13. The department also announced a $6 billion increase to the auction sizes of the 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year note this quarter.

Have to ride the wave through Jan expiration calls. I\u2019m comparing this rise to 2011, as I know most of you are. There were a few sharp pullbacks then too. \n\nThe rise in silver was precipitated by a roughly 2% decrease in real interest rates from 2008 to 2010 in the first round of QE. A second round was confirmed in Nov 2010 with a minimum commitment of 2 years from the Fed. Silver popped its top 6 months later April 2011. It fell from there even though real interest rates were to decline another 2% - many speculate market manipulation by JPM. \n\nWe are now in a situation where real interest rates have fallen 2% from late 2018 to now. The Fed is printing unlimited money, and committed to do so for, you guessed it, 2 years. \n\nNormally I don\u2019t read into the tea leaves too far, but the scale of these macroeconomic factors over a decades worth of data seem to indicate that silver will continue its march upward. The key will be to find a good exit point somewhere along the way. I feel way more comfortable letting this play out over the next few months and not worrying about daily changes.\n\nThe Russian Vaccine seems like a total sham, along with the reporting attributing the sell off to it. It\u2019s been immediately reported that the vaccine has not concluded phase 3 trials yet. The rest of the known world and all biotech companies out there have every incentive to do this the right way. Might as well be saying we should inject bleach into our veins. The same report said that \u201cyields were increasing\u201d, yet I see the rate at -1.02% on the 10 year yield posted by the St. Louis Fed.

There will most likely be a second wave and possible another round of (shorter) lockdowns well before we are anywhere near having a vaccine manufactured en masse. \n\nShort sighted investors are getting shaken out - I view it as a decent opportunity to lower my cost basis.
