You'll be fighting a battle inside of China as they push greater regulations and use BABA as an example and simultaneously from the US government as tensions between the US and China continue to rise.  I don't see international tensions getting better for a variety of reasons and this could manifest itself in a variety of ways. For example, in response to the US not allowing their citizens to do business with various Chinese companies and trade various Chinese equities, the Chinese government might respond by preventing their own firms from being able to list on US exchanges or something like that.  Lots of folks think that the next administration will make nice with China reducing or even removing the increased US-China relationship risk that's currently priced in, but I don't have that opinion.  As long as you know what you're betting against, I think it's okay but I only see more risk presenting itself on both domestically and internationally.  Currently bag holding a decaying pile of 300c 1/15. I'm staying away from Chinese equities, but if you can stomach the risk, I'd hold shares and dollar cost average due to the impact that the aforementioned points may end up having on the share price in the coming day(s)/week(s)/year(s).

Ant ipo was halted because of its incredibly high leverage and the lack of reserve currencies, which posted a great potential risk to the Chinese financial well-being. The investigation launched against Alibaba was a statement made by Chinese government to show its dedication toward a healthy, anti-monopolistic market environment for the tech companies in the future. Not a war waged against Alibaba alone or Jack Ma. Bullish long term (5-10 years)  Edit: That's the reason why it won't dip lower. But not the reason why it will go over 300 or even 350 very soon (before March 2021). I believe as western investors who are feared by the decoupling of China-US, who are feared by this and that, it posts a great opportunity for Chinese market makers to buy into the dip.

            "Well with my friends I had this discussion like 5-6 years ago when we were choosing between investing in Alibaba or Tencent and all of us said Tencent, why? Because Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba is famous, loved, followed and talks a lot. He has also shown in many cases his interests in western ideas, he went on US medias etc. In China, CCP don\u2019t like people that talks a lot, people that are influent and have ties with western countries because they are threat to party! I actually could see this coming from long ago.  Alibaba will be back soon I guess, we are talking about a fucking giant, top 1-2 Chinese company owning Taobao (the Amazon of China), Alipay, E le me (the Deliveroo of China) and many other (there is list of there owning it it\u2019s nuts). No doubt they will stand steel they just need some cleaning and some mouth to shut!",
            "Only lying people talk a lot, what else can I expect from a mouthful, it\u2019s gonna be full of crap.  Jack Ma says usury is an innovation, he is most likely knew Ant Group won\u2019t ipo before he talked shit.   Apparently CCP has its hands choking on Jack Ma\u2019s neck and the investors of Ant Group on his balls sack. He just think he can outplay the government.  Jack Ma\u2019s right-hand man also a shareholder of Ant Group, got jumped by 3 men with knifes in HongKong not long after Ant Group IPO got call out and suspended. Many shareholders of Ant Group are gang related.   Jack Ma deserves harsh punishment. he thinks he can do whatever he want with the wealth and fame, usury\u2019s never been a good thing to the society, it\u2019s like killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  One more thing, the West always mocks how bad quality are Chinese products. Back when there was no internet in China, the southern Chinese would never buy product manufactured in eastern China(Jack Ma\u2019s hometown,near Shanghai), and Alibaba is the one brings the low quality junks to the globe as a middleman.  And people have mad respect for him because he is wealthy and at the same time spit on the products he sells.  It\u2019s not like CCP does whatever it wants. Jack Ma thinks he gets wealthy on his own, no business in China should be successful without support from government(I believe all countries the same because you don\u2019t go against constitution).  And Jack Ma turns his back on CCP as CCP expects him to make Chinese people wealth, instead he brings usury and calls it an innovation. You think margin call is scary? You don\u2019t even get calls from usury, they just strip you naked and take photos and rape you if you are female, or rape any female in your family if you are male. That happened a lot in HongKong before CCP takes back.  Jack Ma deserves hell if he does not know where his place is.",
            "Well Jack Ma is one of the reason China is about to lead the world soon. He is directly at the origin of  thousands of new rich, thousands of new jobs. (All those factories sending goods via Alibaba). I know a lot about that I used to be director of factory in Guangdong and most of our business was selling goods abroad via Alibaba.  China is a totalitarian country, whatever you do, don\u2019t talk and show love to the party (Ma Yun th\u00e9 boss of Tencent is doing it prefectly) this is the way.   Something that always bother me is that Ma made a fortune working all this shit by himself, a crazy story of a poor man that started with nothing and now he is here ! And still people like you diss him instead of pointing out the crazy corruption in China, tones of rich kids from the party that ride Ferrari and super cars abroad. Corruption  is super common in China, any construction any regional plan will always  suffer from people that take the money away, instead of having nice roads they have shit roads and the list goes on. Ma is just taking too much space, and probably too much supporting free trade and open to then world.",
            "Yeah I was talking about Ma Hua Teng. I think and truly think Jack Ma is part of the success of China over the last decade, I am in Guangdong for more than 27 years as I was born there and I can see the change. Alibaba bring jobs and works to any area in China (especially remote area which are still the poorest), yes it is cheap ass stuff yes it brings bad reputation but this is a just transition but we needed this transition and we can see now China  is slowly transitioning, gaining better reputation and making high quality / premium products (Huawei , NIO, XIOMI, DJI etc.. you name it) Don\u2019t get me wrong as an half Chinese citizen I love China and I support China I just think there are some change to be done but still we are on the good way.",
            "I was pointing out the business group in eastern China(\u6d59\u5546\uff09was labeled as liars by the guangdong business group\uff08\u7ca4\u5546\uff09, I mean Jack Ma is leading a group of liars. why would you trust and embrace a leader of a group of liars. many of the brands you mentioned has factories in guangdong instead of zhejiang(Jack Ma den).  Tencent\u2019s boss Ma Hua Teng is also backed by his business group too(\u6f6e\u5546\uff09, there\u2019s really no one man conquer the world here.  Like nio nowadays, lots mention nio is backed by the Hefei government. Alibaba is backed by zhejiang too.   I would say Jack Ma is apart of China success but not China becomes successful because of one man. Businessman don\u2019t script the policies like by 2035 only EV in China.",
            "As I said before you think the best for businessman in China is keep one\u2019s mouth shut and pay to bribe.   The common misconception about alibaba is people look at Jack Ma was talking shit about China financial system like a hero critiques a corrupted system.  Jack Ma knew Ant Group was going down before he did anything so he brought up the critique to make him look like he is a victim and he has balls to go against it.  why would a person go anger CCP right before his company IPO? Because he knows the conflict is on under the table long before media catches it and he choose to strike first. Or trying to blame the failure to CCP so he would get away with the responsibility, a warning from his investors has been sent already as his right-hand man FengLei Qian got jumped with 3 men with knife in hongkong, if the case is worsen by the day, maybe not jack ma himself gets jumped but definitely the ones more closer to him as people behind Jack Ma needs his face pretty at the same time pressure him to make the deal done.  He thinks it\u2019s a smart move but we\u2019ll see.",
            "Well the fact that Ma is talking is not something new, it started way before Ant IPO, this is also a reason he stepped down as a CEO of Alibaba some years ago.  There is no misconception in China you simple don\u2019t criticise the system or you just get shut down the way jack Ma is shut down now. Of course they will always find a way to make you look bad. It just remind me the German scientific who said the virus was originated in China and he gots bashed in Chinese newspaper as pedophile Christians\u2019 fanatic..."

I don't see international tensions getting better for a variety of reasons and this could manifest itself in a variety of ways. For example, in response to the US not allowing their citizens to do business with various Chinese companies and trade various Chinese equities, the Chinese government might respond by preventing their own firms from being able to list on US exchanges or something like that.  Lots of folks think that the next administration will make nice with China reducing or even removing the increased US-China relationship risk that's currently priced in, but I don't have that opinion.  As long as you know what you're betting against, I think it's okay but I only see more risk presenting itself on both domestically and internationally.

Many Chinese hold BABA in their pensions and this isn\u2019t about ruining a company out of spite the way ant financial was structured was actually exposing the economy to systemic risk. They were loaning people money without securing the loans which could have led to rifts in the banking system.",

            "Only lying people talk a lot, what else can I expect from a mouthful, it\u2019s gonna be full of crap.  Jack Ma says usury is an innovation, he is most likely knew Ant Group won\u2019t ipo before he talked shit.   Apparently CCP has its hands choking on Jack Ma\u2019s neck and the investors of Ant Group on his balls sack. He just think he can outplay the government.  Jack Ma\u2019s right-hand man also a shareholder of Ant Group, got jumped by 3 men with knifes in HongKong not long after Ant Group IPO got call out and suspended. Many shareholders of Ant Group are gang related.   Jack Ma deserves harsh punishment. he thinks he can do whatever he want with the wealth and fame, usury\u2019s never been a good thing to the society, it\u2019s like killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  One more thing, the West always mocks how bad quality are Chinese products. Back when there was no internet in China, the southern Chinese would never buy product manufactured in eastern China(Jack Ma\u2019s hometown,near Shanghai), and Alibaba is the one brings the low quality junks to the globe as a middleman.  And people have mad respect for him because he is wealthy and at the same time spit on the products he sells.  It\u2019s not like CCP does whatever it wants. Jack Ma thinks he gets wealthy on his own, no business in China should be successful without support from government(I believe all countries the same because you don\u2019t go against constitution).  And Jack Ma turns his back on CCP as CCP expects him to make Chinese people wealth, instead he brings usury and calls it an innovation. You think margin call is scary? You don\u2019t even get calls from usury, they just strip you naked and take photos and rape you if you are female, or rape any female in your family if you are male. That happened a lot in HongKong before CCP takes back.  Jack Ma deserves hell if he does not know where his place is.",

Tencent\u2019s boss Ma Hua Teng is also backed by his business group too(\u6f6e\u5546\uff09, there\u2019s really no one man conquer the world here.  Like nio nowadays, lots mention nio is backed by the Hefei government. Alibaba is backed by zhejiang too.   I would say Jack Ma is apart of China success but not China becomes successful because of one man. Businessman don\u2019t script the policies like by 2035 only EV in China.",
            "Well the fact that Ma is talking is not something new, it started way before Ant IPO, this is also a reason he stepped down as a CEO of Alibaba some years ago.  There is no misconception in China you simple don\u2019t criticise the system or you just get shut down the way jack Ma is shut down now. Of course they will always find a way to make you look bad. It just remind me the German scientific who said the virus was originated in China and he gots bashed in Chinese newspaper as pedophile Christians\u2019 fanatic..."

Ant ipo was halted because of its incredibly high leverage and the lack of reserve currencies, which posted a great potential risk to the Chinese financial well-being. The investigation launched against Alibaba was a statement made by Chinese government to show its dedication toward a healthy, anti-monopolistic market environment for the tech companies in the future. Not a war waged against Alibaba alone or Jack Ma. Bullish long term (5-10 years)  Edit: That's the reason why it won't dip lower. But not the reason why it will go over 300 or even 350 very soon (before March 2021). I believe as western investors who are feared by the decoupling of China-US, who are feared by this and that, it posts a great opportunity for Chinese market makers to buy into the dip.

I think China is done scoring own goals on its favorite company and just imagine the bounce that will come from the inverse ie when BABA complies and addresses American and Chinese (more strict?) regulatory concerns, crushes numbers again, gets approval for, and then has the ANT IPO.

            "What do you think about baba? Yea they probably won't fail, but more dark days ahead?",
            "Well with my friends I had this discussion like 5-6 years ago when we were choosing between investing in Alibaba or Tencent and all of us said Tencent, why? Because Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba is famous, loved, followed and talks a lot. He has also shown in many cases his interests in western ideas, he went on US medias etc. In China, CCP don\u2019t like people that talks a lot, people that are influent and have ties with western countries because they are threat to party! I actually could see this coming from long ago.  Alibaba will be back soon I guess, we are talking about a fucking giant, top 1-2 Chinese company owning Taobao (the Amazon of China), Alipay, E le me (the Deliveroo of China) and many other (there is list of there owning it it\u2019s nuts). No doubt they will stand steel they just need some cleaning and some mouth to shut!",
            "Well Jack Ma is one of the reason China is about to lead the world soon. He is directly at the origin of  thousands of new rich, thousands of new jobs. (All those factories sending goods via Alibaba). I know a lot about that I used to be director of factory in Guangdong and most of our business was selling goods abroad via Alibaba.  China is a totalitarian country, whatever you do, don\u2019t talk and show love to the party (Ma Yun th\u00e9 boss of Tencent is doing it prefectly) this is the way.   Something that always bother me is that Ma made a fortune working all this shit by himself, a crazy story of a poor man that started with nothing and now he is here ! And still people like you diss him instead of pointing out the crazy corruption in China, tones of rich kids from the party that ride Ferrari and super cars abroad. Corruption  is super common in China, any construction any regional plan will always  suffer from people that take the money away, instead of having nice roads they have shit roads and the list goes on. Ma is just taking too much space, and probably too much supporting free trade and open to then world.",
            "Yeah I was talking about Ma Hua Teng. I think and truly think Jack Ma is part of the success of China over the last decade, I am in Guangdong for more than 27 years as I was born there and I can see the change. Alibaba bring jobs and works to any area in China (especially remote area which are still the poorest), yes it is cheap ass stuff yes it brings bad reputation but this is a just transition but we needed this transition and we can see now China  is slowly transitioning, gaining better reputation and making high quality / premium products (Huawei , NIO, XIOMI, DJI etc.. you name it) Don\u2019t get me wrong as an half Chinese citizen I love China and I support China I just think there are some change to be done but still we are on the good way.",
            "As I said before you think the best for businessman in China is keep one\u2019s mouth shut and pay to bribe.   The common misconception about alibaba is people look at Jack Ma was talking shit about China financial system like a hero critiques a corrupted system.  Jack Ma knew Ant Group was going down before he did anything so he brought up the critique to make him look like he is a victim and he has balls to go against it.  why would a person go anger CCP right before his company IPO? Because he knows the conflict is on under the table long before media catches it and he choose to strike first. Or trying to blame the failure to CCP so he would get away with the responsibility, a warning from his investors has been sent already as his right-hand man FengLei Qian got jumped with 3 men with knife in hongkong, if the case is worsen by the day, maybe not jack ma himself gets jumped but definitely the ones more closer to him as people behind Jack Ma needs his face pretty at the same time pressure him to make the deal done.  He thinks it\u2019s a smart move but we\u2019ll see."

Local tournaments will never be the same over the internet. There's a reason sports streaming services are massive but so are the locations they take place in. Check out what happened to the SSBM community this year. They have planned online tournaments because they cannot take place locally because of the virus. But the demand is huge. Gamestop could become the community hub for gaming!  Local tournaments are just a theory. A GAME THEORIWILLSTOPNOW. But there are also some facts.  Did you notice that gamestop employees are usually avid gamers, too? That's not cause gamers want to work at gamestop, that's because gamestop wants gamers to work at gamestop! If you want to trashtalk a game, an e-sports player or manifacturer they'll probably happily discuss with you.   They aren't planning to rebrand, it's in full motion. Check out their linkedin page! \"Gamestop is the cultural hub to unite the worlds of gaming\" - their new mission statement. They're listing as \"Technology\" and not as \"Retail\" anymore. They have started to offer PC parts both in stores and advertise it on their facebook page. Oh and if you didn't get the newest graphics card or console because some douchebag scalper snagged a few thousands online, watch them try and fail to do so when attempting to do the same with gamestop. Even with same day delivery that'll still be restricted to that stores allowed stock and area so scalping does not scale at all.   As for why buy stuff online at gamestop over any other retailer? Well why do you buy most of your stuff at amazon? Probably because it's pretty much all in one place, it's convenient, prices are often better than competing retailers and all of these will be true for gamestop with everything regarding gaming.",

            "You are correct. P/E ratio doesn't matter for a rapidly growing company since they are constantly reinvesting in infrastructure and capital. They are watching their cash and actually having too high of earnings is a waste - they could have reinvested that money instead. When they \"level off\" and stop growing so fast (i.e. hopefully once they've captured a huge amount of market share), then they'll stop reinvesting so much cash and earnings will catch up to a normal profit margin, reaping the rewards of their growth at that point. Look at Amazon revenue vs profit as they grew:  https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/4298/amazons-long-term-growth/  What does still matter for a growing company though is P/S (price to sales). While they're growing, even if their profit (earnings) isn't high, the fact that they are growing should mean their top line sales (revenue) is growing like crazy. TSLA sales are growing very quickly, but their market cap has grown significantly faster, meaning they have a P/S ratio of almost 20. A normal S&amp;P 500 company has a P/S ratio of like 2. So we're pricing in an implied growth in sales of at least 10x from here. It sounds less horrendous than P/E 1,500 but I still think it's high.

            "I don\u2019t think so. Not nearly as much as buying a call or a put by itself. If you go to optionsprofitcalculator.com and compare a regular call with a spread you can see the difference   But if you\u2019re talking about the spread value jumping when there\u2019s not much movement.. yeah I\u2019ve noticed that with some of the more illiquid tickers. But it hasn\u2019t been an issue for me with stuff like amazon and apple",
            "This has been my bread and butter this year, mostly with AMZN.   You've got a blue chip like stock growing like it's a startup, and crushing high expectations, and still raising guidance.  Whenever it dipped below 3100, and hopefully near 3000, I'd open up a 50 point call spread ATM, or better, ITM.  Only on the monthlies, for an average of a 1:1 risk/reward.  Sometimes 6 weeks out, sometimes 3 months out.  I was shooting for the 1:1 risk/reward, and assuming that 3200 was a good base, so my spreads were never above 3150.   Did I lose some?  Yep.  Doesn't hurt much when the wins are consistent.    Only on monthlies.  Let me repeat that (having been burned on weeklies) only on monthly expirations.",
            "one thing to consider during a bull market, if you can afford it--leg into a debit spread by buying the call.  As the stock continues to move upwards, sell the call for a higher price than had you done it all at once.  I'm not going to do that with AMZN, as the risk is way too expensive for what I have, but I do that for sure with AAPL.",
            "Better to open ATM spreads (buy the ITM call, sell the ATM call) when there's a dip since IV tends to rise too so you get better max profit potential. On AMZN you can sometimes put it on for a 100% profit potential (ie: cost 50 for a max profit of 50, spread is 100).   But not something I run all the time because stocks go up and down, and you generally only want to put it on when you believe stocks are only going up for the duration of the spread.",

            "I can\u2019t say one way or the other about how much money they made when the consoles were restocked, but the fact that there were news headlines and you heard about it says a lot about the gaming community.  RadioShack died because China was able to sell directly through Amazon and the markup on components was too much for some people to pay when they could just order free two day shipping from an online retailer and never leave their house in the first place.   GME does sell gaming products you are correct, and yes they sell both digital and disc style versions of their consoles, but you\u2019re not taking into account the deal that was made with Microsoft earlier this year, and a possibility of a similar deal with Sony (just an idea obviously i dont know) if they do in fact sell more digital consoles. However, they will not because people like the fucking disc. Gamers want to be able to hold it, trade it, sell it, etc. Most of them just like seeing the box art on their shelf. Regardless, gamers have more feelings of nostalgia with their collectibles than maybe another collector because when you like something that\u2019s completely digitized like a video game having a physical in game item is just that much cooler.  Go ahead and buy your Sony stock. That\u2019s not a bad idea IMO, but saying GME is a failing business is simply ignorant or have no vision for what Cohen can create, and that\u2019s fine. I hope you make money elsewhere.",

They\u2019re going to smash earnings and when they transition into the e-commerce space completely you will see them compete with Amazon easily.",
            "They already have an online storefront. How come it isn\u2019t already competing with Amazon?",
            "Because it needs work. I agree the GME looks like it\u2019s covered in shit, but it\u2019s just a shit covered gem right now. When Cohen grabs Sherman by the nuts and polishes the shit off the GME brand by representing it as an established gaming brand in the e-commerce space, then it will compete with Amazon. Things take time. It\u2019s not able to do that right now. They\u2019ve only recently changed directions, and Cohen isn\u2019t afraid to take that over completely from Sherman if he doesn\u2019t do it right. You obviously don\u2019t have the vision for GME like most of us do,  it you have to have that for this to work. You obviously have a vision that Sony will keep designing new consoles/cameras/etc. so that\u2019s why you bought Sony stock. I believe in the new management of GME, and you don\u2019t. I\u2019m gonna leave it at that. I hope you short it in confidence. See you after earnings.",
            "Well with my friends I had this discussion like 5-6 years ago when we were choosing between investing in Alibaba or Tencent and all of us said Tencent, why? Because Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba is famous, loved, followed and talks a lot. He has also shown in many cases his interests in western ideas, he went on US medias etc. In China, CCP don\u2019t like people that talks a lot, people that are influent and have ties with western countries because they are threat to party! I actually could see this coming from long ago.

Their multi year partnership with microsoft is proof of that.  You aren't into Consoles but need a new graphics card? Same day delivery or order and pick up at the store is what they're going for.   Local tournaments will never be the same over the internet. There's a reason sports streaming services are massive but so are the locations they take place in. Check out what happened to the SSBM community this year. They have planned online tournaments because they cannot take place locally because of the virus. But the demand is huge. Gamestop could become the community hub for gaming!  Local tournaments are just a theory. A GAME THEORIWILLSTOPNOW. But there are also some facts.  Did you notice that gamestop employees are usually avid gamers, too? That's not cause gamers want to work at gamestop, that's because gamestop wants gamers to work at gamestop! If you want to trashtalk a game, an e-sports player or manifacturer they'll probably happily discuss with you.   They aren't planning to rebrand, it's in full motion. Check out their linkedin page! \"Gamestop is the cultural hub to unite the worlds of gaming\" - their new mission statement. They're listing as \"Technology\" and not as \"Retail\" anymore. They have started to offer PC parts both in stores and advertise it on their facebook page. Oh and if you didn't get the newest graphics card or console because some douchebag scalper snagged a few thousands online, watch them try and fail to do so when attempting to do the same with gamestop. Even with same day delivery that'll still be restricted to that stores allowed stock and area so scalping does not scale at all.   As for why buy stuff online at gamestop over any other retailer? Well why do you buy most of your stuff at amazon? Probably because it's pretty much all in one place, it's convenient, prices are often better than competing retailers and all of these will be true for gamestop with everything regarding gaming.",

            "You are correct. P/E ratio doesn't matter for a rapidly growing company since they are constantly reinvesting in infrastructure and capital. They are watching their cash and actually having too high of earnings is a waste - they could have reinvested that money instead. When they \"level off\" and stop growing so fast (i.e. hopefully once they've captured a huge amount of market share), then they'll stop reinvesting so much cash and earnings will catch up to a normal profit margin, reaping the rewards of their growth at that point. Look at Amazon revenue vs profit as they grew:  https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/4298/amazons-long-term-growth/  What does still matter for a growing company though is P/S (price to sales). While they're growing, even if their profit (earnings) isn't high, the fact that they are growing should mean their top line sales (revenue) is growing like crazy. TSLA sales are growing very quickly, but their market cap has grown significantly faster, meaning they have a P/S ratio of almost 20. A normal S&amp;P 500 company has a P/S ratio of like 2. So we're pricing in an implied growth in sales of at least 10x from here. It sounds less horrendous than P/E 1,500 but I still think it's high.

You've got a blue chip like stock growing like it's a startup, and crushing high expectations, and still raising guidance.  Whenever it dipped below 3100, and hopefully near 3000, I'd open up a 50 point call spread ATM, or better, ITM.  Only on the monthlies, for an average of a 1:1 risk/reward.  Sometimes 6 weeks out, sometimes 3 months out.  I was shooting for the 1:1 risk/reward, and assuming that 3200 was a good base, so my spreads were never above 3150.   Did I lose some?  Yep.  Doesn't hurt much when the wins are consistent.    Only on monthlies.  Let me repeat that (having been burned on weeklies) only on monthly expirations.",
            "one thing to consider during a bull market, if you can afford it--leg into a debit spread by buying the call.  As the stock continues to move upwards, sell the call for a higher price than had you done it all at once.  I'm not going to do that with AMZN, as the risk is way too expensive for what I have, but I do that for sure with AAPL.",
            "Better to open ATM spreads (buy the ITM call, sell the ATM call) when there's a dip since IV tends to rise too so you get better max profit potential. On AMZN you can sometimes put it on for a 100% profit potential (ie: cost 50 for a max profit of 50, spread is 100).   But not something I run all the time because stocks go up and down, and you generally only want to put it on when you believe stocks are only going up for the duration of the spread.",

RadioShack died because China was able to sell directly through Amazon and the markup on components was too much for some people to pay when they could just order free two day shipping from an online retailer and never leave their house in the first place.   GME does sell gaming products you are correct, and yes they sell both digital and disc style versions of their consoles, but you\u2019re not taking into account the deal that was made with Microsoft earlier this year, and a possibility of a similar deal with Sony (just an idea obviously i dont know) if they do in fact sell more digital consoles. However, they will not because people like the fucking disc. Gamers want to be able to hold it, trade it, sell it, etc. Most of them just like seeing the box art on their shelf. Regardless, gamers have more feelings of nostalgia with their collectibles than maybe another collector because when you like something that\u2019s completely digitized like a video game having a physical in game item is just that much cooler.  Go ahead and buy your Sony stock. That\u2019s not a bad idea IMO, but saying GME is a failing business is simply ignorant or have no vision for what Cohen can create, and that\u2019s fine.

Things take time. It\u2019s not able to do that right now. They\u2019ve only recently changed directions, and Cohen isn\u2019t afraid to take that over completely from Sherman if he doesn\u2019t do it right. You obviously don\u2019t have the vision for GME like most of us do,  it you have to have that for this to work. You obviously have a vision that Sony will keep designing new consoles/cameras/etc. so that\u2019s why you bought Sony stock. I believe in the new management of GME, and you don\u2019t.

They need to partner or buy a company like Ford/GM to avoid the headache of manufacturing cars, so that they can focus on Batteries and software. GM already have their battery tech (Hummer EV).   Also, Apple is rumored to release the car around 2024. That is almost 3-3.5 years from now. That is a lot of time for Tesla to fight off any serious competition.

The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma doesn\u2019t come from rejecting innovation, but underinvesting in what will appear to be a marginal increase in revenue. Is Tim Cook actually willing to spend the tens of billions it could take to built and sustain an automobile/self-driving program, or will it waste years in purgatory like Google\u2019s Waymo? Working on a car and a AR/VR set simultaneously could risk drawing down their cash reserves. That\u2019s not something that bothers me personally, but boomers like buffet would lose patience if Apple had to cut back their buyback program.  Based on Google\u2019s two year quest to buy a watchmaker, Apple probably can\u2019t just acquire their way into the space. Most of the car program will have to come from the ground up.",

These business own assets, have bank accounts and you (by owning a share) are entitled to a portion of it.

In practice though, I'm not sure how tangible that would be, as the company would be unlikely to sell assets and use that money to pay dividends.    About cash, I'm absolutely familiar with the fact that it's not backed by gold, hence why it's a reserve of value which requires make-believe, unlike say golden coins, which at minimum are worth its gold content (although even that value is also relative, golden being also a reserve of value, besides being a commodity).",

Silicon Valley is bloody good with electronics, Europe is not close. China is pretty close to Silicon Valley and that\u2019s why you see nio, xpeng etc get the hype.   Next VW is coming from China.

An electric motor is not changing anytime soon just like the ICE isn't either. Tesla's current batteries aren't very special either and they still don't have the capability to manufacture their own in quantity.   Tesla is like apple tho, they're selling a sexier version of an existing product (iphone vs flip phone). No one needed an iphone in 2007 when it came out, it was just super cool to have. It took a few years but every other manufacturer can make smartphones.

In the VR space (I was working on VR games in the 90s but am only a enthousiast now)  there are MANY companies working on both VR and AR.  Facebook has a significant head start but by no means are they the only one.  And other companies are quickly closing the technology gap and exceeding it.  Now that Facebook has shown the way with Quest it's just a matter of time for some up and comer or someone like Apple to drop a bomb on the market with something new.  Facebook has shown there is gold in the hills and prospectors are going to come running.  Once someone offers something better/cooler we will see Facebook forced to open the walls to others to stay competitive.  Already you see developers fighting back against this and developing games exclusively for SteamVR or WMR.  The last few major titles Facebook had to fund to maintain an exclusive.  The recent Star Wars title Tales from the galaxy's edge is considered a flop by the hard core Star Wars gaming enthousist.  I didn't even buy it and I am such a Star Wars fan I paid $2000 for an original Star Wars movie poster which is framed in my office.  Facebook has made even qualifying to release a title on the Oculus prohibitively difficult.  This is driving developers away from the Oculus platform.  There are many in the current user base that are walking away from the platform.  Myself included.  I have 5 of the Oculus devices.  I was fully committed to the Oculus VR platform from the kickstarter.  I got one of the first CV1s first few days of release (I think mine showed up 2 days after release).  However admittedly I am no longer Facebook's target market.  Now it's the same market as the original Nintendo.  Nintendo is no longer the front runner in the game space.  They are basically an also ran.  I see the same for Facebook at some point.  Finally Facebook is under a lot of legal pressure for monopolistic activity.  Germany just brought a legal claim against them for forcing the use of Facebook on the Quest.  I believe there is one coming in the US as well.  This will likely force them withdraw the requirement for a facebook account.  Then where are they?  I even see social media going away.  The social media crowd is a fickle bunch.  People are leaving Facebook in droves.  The adoption of Facebook and VR is an attempt to stave off the loss of the user base.  The social media crowd is all about the latest and greatest.

In the VR space (I was working on VR games in the 90s but am only a enthousiast now)  there are MANY companies working on both VR and AR.  Facebook has a significant head start but by no means are they the only one.  And other companies are quickly closing the technology gap and exceeding it.  Now that Facebook has shown the way with Quest it's just a matter of time for some up and comer or someone like Apple to drop a bomb on the market with something new.  Facebook has shown there is gold in the hills and prospectors are going to come running.  Once someone offers something better/cooler we will see Facebook forced to open the walls to others to stay competitive.  Already you see developers fighting back against this and developing games exclusively for SteamVR or WMR.  The last few major titles Facebook had to fund to maintain an exclusive.  The recent Star Wars title Tales from the galaxy's edge is considered a flop by the hard core Star Wars gaming enthousist.  I didn't even buy it and I am such a Star Wars fan I paid $2000 for an original Star Wars movie poster which is framed in my office.  Facebook has made even qualifying to release a title on the Oculus prohibitively difficult.  This is driving developers away from the Oculus platform.  There are many in the current user base that are walking away from the platform.  Myself included.  I have 5 of the Oculus devices.  I was fully committed to the Oculus VR platform from the kickstarter.  I got one of the first CV1s first few days of release (I think mine showed up 2 days after release).  However admittedly I am no longer Facebook's target market.  Now it's the same market as the original Nintendo.  Nintendo is no longer the front runner in the game space.  They are basically an also ran.  I see the same for Facebook at some point.  Finally Facebook is under a lot of legal pressure for monopolistic activity.  Germany just brought a legal claim against them for forcing the use of Facebook on the Quest.  I believe there is one coming in the US as well.  This will likely force them withdraw the requirement for a facebook account.  Then where are they?  I even see social media going away.  The social media crowd is a fickle bunch.  People are leaving Facebook in droves.  The adoption of Facebook and VR is an attempt to stave off the loss of the user base.  The social media crowd is all about the latest and greatest.  Now that Grandma is on Facebook it's no longer cool so you see \"kids\" moving to the next new thing.  Likely we are seeing the peak of Facebook.  If not now, in the near future.",

If you have a problem with non-dividend shares not having value, wait til you find out about paper money not being back by gold &amp; silver!    It\u2019s like saying that owning a savings account full of money has no value unless you think someone will pay more for it.  Not the case.  These business own assets, have bank accounts and you (by owning a share) are entitled to a portion of it.    Look at Apple pre-dividend days- at the end of 2012 &amp; beginning of 2013, they literally had more money in the bank &amp; assets per share than their share price.  They could have been bought out for the current share price &amp; the each share would have profited.",
            "Apple has said they want to get into the electric vehicle industry so who even knows at this point",
            "You certainly make a good point about the possibility of voting to start paying dividends. In that case, those shares would indeed have intric value.  The other part of the intrinsic value would indeed be the assets owned by the company, like in your apple example. In practice though, I'm not sure how tangible that would be, as the company would be unlikely to sell assets and use that money to pay dividends.    About cash, I'm absolutely familiar with the fact that it's not backed by gold, hence why it's a reserve of value which requires make-believe, unlike say golden coins, which at minimum are worth its gold content (although even that value is also relative, golden being also a reserve of value, besides being a commodity).",

            "One thing apple is good at is hardware. They are unbeatable in hardware.  Apple also has the worlds greatest supply chain for electronics. Tim Cook was their supply chain guy and there is a reason why he was Steve jobs\u2019s choice to replace him.    And apple can get some company like Volkswagen to make their cars. Or even get a Asian vendor to make them like their phones.  Apple has enough liquid cash in the bank to buy VW 4 times over. Let that sink in for a second.  Apple is no joke, it has serious muscle behind it. And they don\u2019t get into stuff without thinking through it well.   Source: electrical engineering guy working in Silicon Valley designing consumer electronics products for a major tech company (not apple).  Apple is a beast in our industry, I am surprised they are getting into electric cars, but not surprised at the same time. I have been seeing apple\u2019s self driving test cars in Silicon Valley streets since 2017.   This is something to watch out for. Trust me on this one.",
            "Well maybe if Apple went back to innovating then maybe they\u2019d see more growth",
            "iPhone has been invented and you are talking about betting on Motorola and Nokia.  Sure, not a perfect metaphor as apple was not an upstart when iPhone was invented. But there are a lot of parallels.  For one, you underestimate how hard it is to make electric cars. First model s was launched in 2012, its been 8 years and even now, there aren\u2019t half decent equivalents from European car companies that can compete with the model s. Ever wondered why?   The meat behind electric cars is electronics, software and AI like self driving technology. Tesla was born in the part of the world that is the best at all of this. Europe is decades behind on AI, Machine learning compared to Silicon Valley, VW has no hopes of catching up to google/tesla with self driving tech. Silicon Valley is bloody good with electronics, Europe is not close. China is pretty close to Silicon Valley and that\u2019s why you see nio, xpeng etc get the hype.   Next VW is coming from China. Tesla is the Ford/GM of the 60s from the US. Europe is falling behind because all the core technologies required to make great electric cars are not their strengths.",
            "Probably because Apple is going to make their own car and it will be even better than a Tesla.",
            "I'm not really sure I'd agree. The fancy technology and AI driving really have nothing to do with developing an electric car. Those may be the future of the industry but it's not necessary to have in a car electric or otherwise. The real tech in an electric car is the battery pack. An electric motor is not changing anytime soon just like the ICE isn't either. Tesla's current batteries aren't very special either and they still don't have the capability to manufacture their own in quantity.   Tesla is like apple tho, they're selling a sexier version of an existing product (iphone vs flip phone). No one needed an iphone in 2007 when it came out, it was just super cool to have. It took a few years but every other manufacturer can make smartphones. If they can keep selling the tesla as a status symbol like apple then that's money but don't pretend they have some secret sauce.  Now if the battery day technology actually pans out then they would be decades ahead in battery tech but that's pretty out there.",
            "No one else but Tesla is booking $8,000 OTA software upgrades in the automotive space. That is pure profit, and it\u2019s more than an iPhone user will spend with Apple in their entire lifetime.   If Apple was growing as fast as Tesla: Apple had revenue of $260b last year, would hit $415b this year, then $665b next year.",

It is expected that they will compete in the EV space, but both entities have other businesses where they aren't competitors at all. Their strategies might turn out to be different, as well. In fact, I expect that to be the case.",
            "You disagree that Apple now has to compete with Tesla? Or you disagree that Tesla was a worthy purchase? If it's the latter, you gotta be shitting me. Imagine if you could buy Tesla at $40/share right now. That's the kind of opportunity Tim Cook had, albeit far less obvious at the time. If it's the former, you must think Apple is going to blow Tesla out of the water. If there's one thing I know about capitalist competition, it'll only drive Tesla to develop even more impressive tech.",

Since growing my account I've started to widen the strikes and to take on a little more risk. You could open a 2-3 month spread with a $30 strike gap and bump your return potential up to 3:1 with a break even only a few dollars above current value.   AAPL has excellent fundamentals, PE within reason comparatively to the market, products lead the market, every index investor continues to boost value, and promise of delivering autonomous systems while getting into the subscription service market.   It may not be as sexy as some other premium products but while the fed continues to prop this market up I'm willing to bet it's one of the most secure investments available.   Not to mention it is one of the most traded options available making sure you get accurate premiums and liquidity.",

You get to scratch the itch of doing options with better risk management.   My strategy is to look for expiries 2 months out, find a spread trading at 60% or less of potential max value (so $3 or less for a $5 spread) and then close out when it gets to about 80% of max value.   The only downsides are that there's no thrill of seeing your options explode in value even when the stock has a good run-up and you can hit max loss if there's a big dip.",

But it hasn\u2019t been an issue for me with stuff like amazon and apple",
            "one thing to consider during a bull market, if you can afford it--leg into a debit spread by buying the call.  As the stock continues to move upwards, sell the call for a higher price than had you done it all at once.  I'm not going to do that with AMZN, as the risk is way too expensive for what I have, but I do that for sure with AAPL.",

            "Give it to me, I'll take real good care of it /s  Basically:  1. Essentially, you're playing the opposite side of a traditional \"buy option --&gt; sell option\" trade. You're paid a premium for taking on the \"risk\" of having your shares of a stock called away and given to someone else or being forced to buy shares at a price you choose. You're the one who will sell to open and buy to close (seems confusing, but trust me it's not). The thing is, as long as you are selling those options for the shares above the price you bought them at, you're profiting no matter what, in a sense.  2. Volatile stocks, or better said stocks with high implied volatility (IV) have the best premiums. Stuff like GME, PLTR, and other meme stocks have lots of retail speculators willing to pay higher premiums for the chance to hit it big. Basically they're holding a burning lottery ticket that we've sold them. You *could* do it on SPY but since SPY is around $37,000 required to play either side, most people will just stick with stocks in the $10-50 range since it allows you to diversify pretty well but also focus on higher IV stocks. Right now I am selling options on AAL, CCL, PLTR, FSR, ACB and a few others. The great thing about selling options is that when you \"lose\" you still kind of win, and when you win you win more than you planned for originally. It's really rare and really hard to actually take a large loss.  The drawbacks are that you can't get an insane slam dunk 100000% gain like you see on a lot of WSB posts and that you'll basically always be managing your portfolio and rotating things in and out. It's a sort of active investment strategy for people who don't care about getting $100,000 in one day but instead just want $1000 in one week. For me, it's a way to escape the 9-5 and still get the thrill of being an active trader."

You're paid a premium for taking on the \"risk\" of having your shares of a stock called away and given to someone else or being forced to buy shares at a price you choose. You're the one who will sell to open and buy to close (seems confusing, but trust me it's not). The thing is, as long as you are selling those options for the shares above the price you bought them at, you're profiting no matter what, in a sense.  2. Volatile stocks, or better said stocks with high implied volatility (IV) have the best premiums. Stuff like GME, PLTR, and other meme stocks have lots of retail speculators willing to pay higher premiums for the chance to hit it big. Basically they're holding a burning lottery ticket that we've sold them. You *could* do it on SPY but since SPY is around $37,000 required to play either side, most people will just stick with stocks in the $10-50 range since it allows you to diversify pretty well but also focus on higher IV stocks. Right now I am selling options on AAL, CCL, PLTR, FSR, ACB and a few others. The great thing about selling options is that when you \"lose\" you still kind of win, and when you win you win more than you planned for originally. It's really rare and really hard to actually take a large loss.  The drawbacks are that you can't get an insane slam dunk 100000% gain like you see on a lot of WSB posts and that you'll basically always be managing your portfolio and rotating things in and out. It's a sort of active investment strategy for people who don't care about getting $100,000 in one day but instead just want $1000 in one week. For me, it's a way to escape the 9-5 and still get the thrill of being an active trader."

Used consoles were all gone, used games thinning out. Disk games hold value over a download code where Cyberpunk being pulled from PS store, prices.   Btw, Cyberpunk 2077 PS4 disks all sold out because you can\u2019t download it.

Merchandise is the name of the game for them, when a couple wants matching sweaters of their favorite characters.   Second point: Streaming is not gaming. GameStop is pivoting to a new segment called streaming where a girl who loves to show off her cats but needs equipment, could stroll in and leave with a StreamDeck by Elgato, the Razer ringlight webcam, and other peripherals needed for said streaming. It\u2019s not just limited to gamers.  Point three: you think every parent who has a kid begging for a new console is looking at PS5/Series X? Those used consoles from what I saw long before Christmas moved like hot cakes. Take your privilege down a notch and realize many will choose that just to make their young ones happy with something better than what they have now. Preowned consoles that work don\u2019t exist outside of the internet, unless you go to GameStop. Good luck online looking for a bargain, when you can simply pick it up and see it for yourself.  Point Four: good luck if your digital download gets an hero\u2019d like every PS5 customer who wants to play Cyberpunk and goes to the PS store. At least with a disk, you actually own it so nice strawman argument.  Point Five: yes, I\u2019m into that shitty stuff. Your opinion is irrelevant to me because I got more value for my money than a download code to a shitty game. I work in car sales during the week and when I have to fetch new leases... have you heard the OST to Cyberpunk on a X6M stereo? Or a Lexus GS?

            "Give it to me, I'll take real good care of it /s  Basically:  1. Essentially, you're playing the opposite side of a traditional \"buy option --&gt; sell option\" trade. You're paid a premium for taking on the \"risk\" of having your shares of a stock called away and given to someone else or being forced to buy shares at a price you choose. You're the one who will sell to open and buy to close (seems confusing, but trust me it's not). The thing is, as long as you are selling those options for the shares above the price you bought them at, you're profiting no matter what, in a sense.  2. Volatile stocks, or better said stocks with high implied volatility (IV) have the best premiums. Stuff like GME, PLTR, and other meme stocks have lots of retail speculators willing to pay higher premiums for the chance to hit it big. Basically they're holding a burning lottery ticket that we've sold them. You *could* do it on SPY but since SPY is around $37,000 required to play either side, most people will just stick with stocks in the $10-50 range since it allows you to diversify pretty well but also focus on higher IV stocks. Right now I am selling options on AAL, CCL, PLTR, FSR, ACB and a few others. The great thing about selling options is that when you \"lose\" you still kind of win, and when you win you win more than you planned for originally. It's really rare and really hard to actually take a large loss.  The drawbacks are that you can't get an insane slam dunk 100000% gain like you see on a lot of WSB posts and that you'll basically always be managing your portfolio and rotating things in and out. It's a sort of active investment strategy for people who don't care about getting $100,000 in one day but instead just want $1000 in one week. For me, it's a way to escape the 9-5 and still get the thrill of being an active trader.",

I get that the price of steel can go up, possibly improving margins.. however, if there is not enough raw material to process to increase sales volume, how does the company make more money beyond just price gouging?  What we would like to see is a lack of production capacity and then MT step in to fill that need...in other words, a demand increase with no raw material shortage. Which would allow for a price increase and steady volume growth.  A raw material shortage is not as bullish as it sounds. The industry does not exist with being able to produce its steel products.

Merchandise is the name of the game for them, when a couple wants matching sweaters of their favorite characters.   Second point: Streaming is not gaming. GameStop is pivoting to a new segment called streaming where a girl who loves to show off her cats but needs equipment, could stroll in and leave with a StreamDeck by Elgato, the Razer ringlight webcam, and other peripherals needed for said streaming. It\u2019s not just limited to gamers.  Point three: you think every parent who has a kid begging for a new console is looking at PS5/Series X? Those used consoles from what I saw long before Christmas moved like hot cakes. Take your privilege down a notch and realize many will choose that just to make their young ones happy with something better than what they have now. Preowned consoles that work don\u2019t exist outside of the internet, unless you go to GameStop. Good luck online looking for a bargain, when you can simply pick it up and see it for yourself.  Point Four: good luck if your digital download gets an hero\u2019d like every PS5 customer who wants to play Cyberpunk and goes to the PS store. At least with a disk, you actually own it so nice strawman argument.  Point Five: yes, I\u2019m into that shitty stuff. Your opinion is irrelevant to me because I got more value for my money than a download code to a shitty game. I work in car sales during the week and when I have to fetch new leases... have you heard the OST to Cyberpunk on a X6M stereo? Or a Lexus GS?

            "Give it to me, I'll take real good care of it /s  Basically:  1. Essentially, you're playing the opposite side of a traditional \"buy option --&gt; sell option\" trade. You're paid a premium for taking on the \"risk\" of having your shares of a stock called away and given to someone else or being forced to buy shares at a price you choose. You're the one who will sell to open and buy to close (seems confusing, but trust me it's not). The thing is, as long as you are selling those options for the shares above the price you bought them at, you're profiting no matter what, in a sense.  2. Volatile stocks, or better said stocks with high implied volatility (IV) have the best premiums. Stuff like GME, PLTR, and other meme stocks have lots of retail speculators willing to pay higher premiums for the chance to hit it big. Basically they're holding a burning lottery ticket that we've sold them. You *could* do it on SPY but since SPY is around $37,000 required to play either side, most people will just stick with stocks in the $10-50 range since it allows you to diversify pretty well but also focus on higher IV stocks. Right now I am selling options on AAL, CCL, PLTR, FSR, ACB and a few others. The great thing about selling options is that when you \"lose\" you still kind of win, and when you win you win more than you planned for originally. It's really rare and really hard to actually take a large loss.  The drawbacks are that you can't get an insane slam dunk 100000% gain like you see on a lot of WSB posts and that you'll basically always be managing your portfolio and rotating things in and out. It's a sort of active investment strategy for people who don't care about getting $100,000 in one day but instead just want $1000 in one week. For me, it's a way to escape the 9-5 and still get the thrill of being an active trader.",

What we would like to see is a lack of production capacity and then MT step in to fill that need...in other words, a demand increase with no raw material shortage.

Even with same day delivery that'll still be restricted to that stores allowed stock and area so scalping does not scale at all.   As for why buy stuff online at gamestop over any other retailer?

Facebook has a significant head start but by no means are they the only one.  And other companies are quickly closing the technology gap and exceeding it.  Now that Facebook has shown the way with Quest it's just a matter of time for some up and comer or someone like Apple to drop a bomb on the market with something new.  Facebook has shown there is gold in the hills and prospectors are going to come running.

I didn't even buy it and I am such a Star Wars fan I paid $2000 for an original Star Wars movie poster which is framed in my office.

They have started to offer PC parts both in stores and advertise it on their facebook page. Oh and if you didn't get the newest graphics card or console because some douchebag scalper snagged a few thousands online, watch them try and fail to do so when attempting to do the same with gamestop. Even with same day delivery that'll still be restricted to that stores allowed stock and area so scalping does not scale at all.   As for why buy stuff online at gamestop over any other retailer? Well why do you buy most of your stuff at amazon? Probably because it's pretty much all in one place, it's convenient, prices are often better than competing retailers and all of these will be true for gamestop with everything regarding gaming.",

The meat behind electric cars is electronics, software and AI like self driving technology. Tesla was born in the part of the world that is the best at all of this. Europe is decades behind on AI, Machine learning compared to Silicon Valley, VW has no hopes of catching up to google/tesla with self driving tech. Silicon Valley is bloody good with electronics, Europe is not close. China is pretty close to Silicon Valley and that\u2019s why you see nio, xpeng etc get the hype.   Next VW is coming from China. Tesla is the Ford/GM of the 60s from the US. Europe is falling behind because all the core technologies required to make great electric cars are not their strengths.",

Edit2: It was about $4800. Damn. I should not have done this math.  Edit3: I even lost money on TSLA when I sold it. It was during a dip that I expected to be a long downward trend because they were having a hard time making enough cars and the reports coming from a whistleblower inside the factory made it sound like a total shit show and a recipe for disaster (like I expected somebody to get killed on the floor or something because they were reportedly being so sloppy with safety).

They need to partner or buy a company like Ford/GM to avoid the headache of manufacturing cars, so that they can focus on Batteries and software. GM already have their battery tech (Hummer EV).   Also, Apple is rumored to release the car around 2024. That is almost 3-3.5 years from now. That is a lot of time for Tesla to fight off any serious competition. Their $25k car would be amazing as well. Tesla weak points are the interior and the cybertruck.  On the other hand Apple, have their unique way of doing things. So let's see how it goes.",

The meat behind electric cars is electronics, software and AI like self driving technology. Tesla was born in the part of the world that is the best at all of this. Europe is decades behind on AI, Machine learning compared to Silicon Valley, VW has no hopes of catching up to google/tesla with self driving tech. Silicon Valley is bloody good with electronics, Europe is not close. China is pretty close to Silicon Valley and that\u2019s why you see nio, xpeng etc get the hype.   Next VW is coming from China.

(I seem to remember watching a video about mathematicians making a lot of money on FOREX in the 70s by just using mathematical models on the charts, no fundamental analysis).  In any case, they do work. Of course you're not going to invest your money on a stock only by looking at chart patterns, it would be stupid to invest in bad companies this way. But if there's a company you've been eyeing for which you like the fundamentals, it's definitely worth looking at the chart patterns to decide when you're going to buy in. Oftentimes you can guess if there's a dip coming, or a gap up, and those things can happen regardless of the fundamentals for the company.  I'd go so far as to say (but maybe this is a little too out there) that just because it's hard to interpret something like this doesn't make it voodoo magic. I'm fairly convinced there is something more to chart analysis than just the psychological factor, and even though we can't really explain why it works doesn't mean it's all random. But that's more intuition than science at this point."

This will likely force them withdraw the requirement for a facebook account.  Then where are they?  I even see social media going away.  The social media crowd is a fickle bunch.  People are leaving Facebook in droves.  The adoption of Facebook and VR is an attempt to stave off the loss of the user base.  The social media crowd is all about the latest and greatest.  Now that Grandma is on Facebook it's no longer cool so you see \"kids\" moving to the next new thing.  Likely we are seeing the peak of Facebook.  If not now, in the near future.",

Since growing my account I've started to widen the strikes and to take on a little more risk. You could open a 2-3 month spread with a $30 strike gap and bump your return potential up to 3:1 with a break even only a few dollars above current value.   AAPL has excellent fundamentals, PE within reason comparatively to the market, products lead the market, every index investor continues to boost value, and promise of delivering autonomous systems while getting into the subscription service market.   It may not be as sexy as some other premium products but while the fed continues to prop this market up I'm willing to bet it's one of the most secure investments available.   Not to mention it is one of the most traded options available making sure you get accurate premiums and liquidity.",
            "Unpopular opinion for this sub: chart patterns are more than just psychological. And I believe they worked before people knew about them. (I seem to remember watching a video about mathematicians making a lot of money on FOREX in the 70s by just using mathematical models on the charts, no fundamental analysis).  In any case, they do work. Of course you're not going to invest your money on a stock only by looking at chart patterns, it would be stupid to invest in bad companies this way. But if there's a company you've been eyeing for which you like the fundamentals, it's definitely worth looking at the chart patterns to decide when you're going to buy in. Oftentimes you can guess if there's a dip coming, or a gap up, and those things can happen regardless of the fundamentals for the company.  I'd go so far as to say (but maybe this is a little too out there) that just because it's hard to interpret something like this doesn't make it voodoo magic. I'm fairly convinced there is something more to chart analysis than just the psychological factor, and even though we can't really explain why it works doesn't mean it's all random. But that's more intuition than science at this point."

Their multi year partnership with microsoft is proof of that.  You aren't into Consoles but need a new graphics card? Same day delivery or order and pick up at the store is what they're going for.   Local tournaments will never be the same over the internet. There's a reason sports streaming services are massive but so are the locations they take place in. Check out what happened to the SSBM community this year. They have planned online tournaments because they cannot take place locally because of the virus. But the demand is huge. Gamestop could become the community hub for gaming!  Local tournaments are just a theory. A GAME THEORIWILLSTOPNOW. But there are also some facts.  Did you notice that gamestop employees are usually avid gamers, too? That's not cause gamers want to work at gamestop, that's because gamestop wants gamers to work at gamestop! If you want to trashtalk a game, an e-sports player or manifacturer they'll probably happily discuss with you.   They aren't planning to rebrand, it's in full motion. Check out their linkedin page! \"Gamestop is the cultural hub to unite the worlds of gaming\" - their new mission statement. They're listing as \"Technology\" and not as \"Retail\" anymore. They have started to offer PC parts both in stores and advertise it on their facebook page. Oh and if you didn't get the newest graphics card or console because some douchebag scalper snagged a few thousands online, watch them try and fail to do so when attempting to do the same with gamestop. Even with same day delivery that'll still be restricted to that stores allowed stock and area so scalping does not scale at all.   As for why buy stuff online at gamestop over any other retailer? Well why do you buy most of your stuff at amazon? Probably because it's pretty much all in one place, it's convenient, prices are often better than competing retailers and all of these will be true for gamestop with everything regarding gaming.",

However, they will not because people like the fucking disc. Gamers want to be able to hold it, trade it, sell it, etc. Most of them just like seeing the box art on their shelf. Regardless, gamers have more feelings of nostalgia with their collectibles than maybe another collector because when you like something that\u2019s completely digitized like a video game having a physical in game item is just that much cooler.

Enter Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry and an army of retail investors putting pressure on the execs to make up for lost time in the online sales arena (better late than never). Microsoft soon inked a profit sharing deal on digital downloads bought on Game Stop sold devices.  Suddenly a \"dying\" brick and mortar company has a few lifelines to keep them afloat while they make a legitimate effort to evolve into an online company. Meanwhile many gamers still require physical disk purchases due to lagging internet speeds.   Next generation console releases also ensure that that the resale market should continue booming into 2021.   GME is now looking at multiple high revenue quarters on the horizon.

The stock market had a lot of smart people managing funds in it. They know the realistic timeline for the actual economy to get back and track. My prediction is things happen one of two ways.   A. The economy starts to recover as the vaccine reaches herd immunity levels, interest rates remain near 0 and companies take off in the biggest bull market ever seen in 2021 going into 2022.   B. The economy starts to recover, interest rates are raised as a result, housing and the stock market both ended a bear market for a year or two.   I guess c if we are gonna have a c would be a mixture of both. Economy recovers. Fed SLOWLY  raises interest rates causing a stagnant market eventually leading to a period of a bear market.   I say either way whatever you\u2019re buying today in 10 years is gonna be worth a ton if it doesn\u2019t go bankrupt and is managed wel. RE: PLTR, NIO, TSLA  all future technologies.

The stock market had a lot of smart people managing funds in it. They know the realistic timeline for the actual economy to get back and track. My prediction is things happen one of two ways.   A. The economy starts to recover as the vaccine reaches herd immunity levels, interest rates remain near 0 and companies take off in the biggest bull market ever seen in 2021 going into 2022.   B. The economy starts to recover, interest rates are raised as a result, housing and the stock market both ended a bear market for a year or two.   I guess c if we are gonna have a c would be a mixture of both. Economy recovers. Fed SLOWLY  raises interest rates causing a stagnant market eventually leading to a period of a bear market.   I say either way whatever you\u2019re buying today in 10 years is gonna be worth a ton if it doesn\u2019t go bankrupt and is managed wel. RE: PLTR, NIO, TSLA  all future technologies. I see GME as a short window opportunity and a watch and see approach. I\u2019ll likely limit my portfolio as we get nearer to the 1 year mark.

First model s was launched in 2012, its been 8 years and even now, there aren\u2019t half decent equivalents from European car companies that can compete with the model s. Ever wondered why?   The meat behind electric cars is electronics, software and AI like self driving technology. Tesla was born in the part of the world that is the best at all of this. Europe is decades behind on AI, Machine learning compared to Silicon Valley, VW has no hopes of catching up to google/tesla with self driving tech. Silicon Valley is bloody good with electronics, Europe is not close. China is pretty close to Silicon Valley and that\u2019s why you see nio, xpeng etc get the hype.   Next VW is coming from China. Tesla is the Ford/GM of the 60s from the US. Europe is falling behind because all the core technologies required to make great electric cars are not their strengths.",

The stock market had a lot of smart people managing funds in it. They know the realistic timeline for the actual economy to get back and track. My prediction is things happen one of two ways.   A. The economy starts to recover as the vaccine reaches herd immunity levels, interest rates remain near 0 and companies take off in the biggest bull market ever seen in 2021 going into 2022.   B. The economy starts to recover, interest rates are raised as a result, housing and the stock market both ended a bear market for a year or two.   I guess c if we are gonna have a c would be a mixture of both. Economy recovers. Fed SLOWLY  raises interest rates causing a stagnant market eventually leading to a period of a bear market.

            "Give it to me, I'll take real good care of it /s  Basically:  1. Essentially, you're playing the opposite side of a traditional \"buy option --&gt; sell option\" trade. You're paid a premium for taking on the \"risk\" of having your shares of a stock called away and given to someone else or being forced to buy shares at a price you choose. You're the one who will sell to open and buy to close (seems confusing, but trust me it's not). The thing is, as long as you are selling those options for the shares above the price you bought them at, you're profiting no matter what, in a sense.  2. Volatile stocks, or better said stocks with high implied volatility (IV) have the best premiums. Stuff like GME, PLTR, and other meme stocks have lots of retail speculators willing to pay higher premiums for the chance to hit it big. Basically they're holding a burning lottery ticket that we've sold them. You *could* do it on SPY but since SPY is around $37,000 required to play either side, most people will just stick with stocks in the $10-50 range since it allows you to diversify pretty well but also focus on higher IV stocks. Right now I am selling options on AAL, CCL, PLTR, FSR, ACB and a few others. The great thing about selling options is that when you \"lose\" you still kind of win, and when you win you win more than you planned for originally. It's really rare and really hard to actually take a large loss.  The drawbacks are that you can't get an insane slam dunk 100000% gain like you see on a lot of WSB posts and that you'll basically always be managing your portfolio and rotating things in and out. It's a sort of active investment strategy for people who don't care about getting $100,000 in one day but instead just want $1000 in one week. For me, it's a way to escape the 9-5 and still get the thrill of being an active trader.",

The stock market had a lot of smart people managing funds in it. They know the realistic timeline for the actual economy to get back and track. My prediction is things happen one of two ways.   A. The economy starts to recover as the vaccine reaches herd immunity levels, interest rates remain near 0 and companies take off in the biggest bull market ever seen in 2021 going into 2022.   B. The economy starts to recover, interest rates are raised as a result, housing and the stock market both ended a bear market for a year or two.   I guess c if we are gonna have a c would be a mixture of both. Economy recovers. Fed SLOWLY  raises interest rates causing a stagnant market eventually leading to a period of a bear market.

            "Give it to me, I'll take real good care of it /s  Basically:  1. Essentially, you're playing the opposite side of a traditional \"buy option --&gt; sell option\" trade. You're paid a premium for taking on the \"risk\" of having your shares of a stock called away and given to someone else or being forced to buy shares at a price you choose. You're the one who will sell to open and buy to close (seems confusing, but trust me it's not). The thing is, as long as you are selling those options for the shares above the price you bought them at, you're profiting no matter what, in a sense.  2. Volatile stocks, or better said stocks with high implied volatility (IV) have the best premiums. Stuff like GME, PLTR, and other meme stocks have lots of retail speculators willing to pay higher premiums for the chance to hit it big. Basically they're holding a burning lottery ticket that we've sold them. You *could* do it on SPY but since SPY is around $37,000 required to play either side, most people will just stick with stocks in the $10-50 range since it allows you to diversify pretty well but also focus on higher IV stocks. Right now I am selling options on AAL, CCL, PLTR, FSR, ACB and a few others. The great thing about selling options is that when you \"lose\" you still kind of win, and when you win you win more than you planned for originally. It's really rare and really hard to actually take a large loss.  The drawbacks are that you can't get an insane slam dunk 100000% gain like you see on a lot of WSB posts and that you'll basically always be managing your portfolio and rotating things in and out. It's a sort of active investment strategy for people who don't care about getting $100,000 in one day but instead just want $1000 in one week. For me, it's a way to escape the 9-5 and still get the thrill of being an active trader.",

If you have a 20k loan compounding at 8% (a number i pulled from my anus btw) then your net worth decreases by 8% of 20k every year you carry that debt. By paying off the 20k, you save yourself from paying additional interest. I'll put it another way, say you start the year with a 20k loan out at 10% (to make the math easy), and you also conveniently have 20k cash in the bank. Your net worth is zero. If you pay off your loan and wait a year (assuming you spend everything you earn and take no more debt) obviously you have a net worth of zero. Now lets say instead you decide to put that money in an ETF that goes up by exactly 10% and keep the loan. At the end of the year, your ETF portfolio is worth 20k+10% interest = 22k, but your debt is also 20k+10% interest = 22k. Your net worth is still 0. Paying off a loan has the same effect on your net worth as making an investment with the same interest rate.",

People dont call into his show asking if they should keep money at an institution, they ask for his opinion on certain stocks (you might glean some info about whether you should stay with an institution based on if their stock is in danger, but that certainly was not the point of Cramer's advice on Bear).

            "You're getting negative return by holding that debt though. If you have a 20k loan compounding at 8% (a number i pulled from my anus btw) then your net worth decreases by 8% of 20k every year you carry that debt. By paying off the 20k, you save yourself from paying additional interest. I'll put it another way, say you start the year with a 20k loan out at 10% (to make the math easy), and you also conveniently have 20k cash in the bank. Your net worth is zero. If you pay off your loan and wait a year (assuming you spend everything you earn and take no more debt) obviously you have a net worth of zero. Now lets say instead you decide to put that money in an ETF that goes up by exactly 10% and keep the loan. At the end of the year, your ETF portfolio is worth 20k+10% interest = 22k, but your debt is also 20k+10% interest = 22k. Your net worth is still 0. Paying off a loan has the same effect on your net worth as making an investment with the same interest rate.",

The economy starts to recover as the vaccine reaches herd immunity levels, interest rates remain near 0 and companies take off in the biggest bull market ever seen in 2021 going into 2022.   B. The economy starts to recover, interest rates are raised as a result, housing and the stock market both ended a bear market for a year or two.   I guess c if we are gonna have a c would be a mixture of both. Economy recovers. Fed SLOWLY  raises interest rates causing a stagnant market eventually leading to a period of a bear market.

But, if you sell those 100 shares you owe taxes on the capital gain even if you never take the cash out of the trading account or immediately reinvest. Your brokerage should give you a statement early each year that gives you all the information you need to tell the IRS what gains you realized.

            "You are correct. P/E ratio doesn't matter for a rapidly growing company since they are constantly reinvesting in infrastructure and capital. They are watching their cash and actually having too high of earnings is a waste - they could have reinvested that money instead. When they \"level off\" and stop growing so fast (i.e. hopefully once they've captured a huge amount of market share), then they'll stop reinvesting so much cash and earnings will catch up to a normal profit margin, reaping the rewards of their growth at that point. Look at Amazon revenue vs profit as they grew:  https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/4298/amazons-long-term-growth/  What does still matter for a growing company though is P/S (price to sales). While they're growing, even if their profit (earnings) isn't high, the fact that they are growing should mean their top line sales (revenue) is growing like crazy. TSLA sales are growing very quickly, but their market cap has grown significantly faster, meaning they have a P/S ratio of almost 20. A normal S&amp;P 500 company has a P/S ratio of like 2. So we're pricing in an implied growth in sales of at least 10x from here. It sounds less horrendous than P/E 1,500 but I still think it's high. Tesla has a great headstart but there's LOTS of competition coming quickly from established players.",

            "Well, you're not specifically asking anyone but here's what I've found to be good useful info:  If you trade for 5-10%, that's fine, if it works out long term. It's certainly the 'book way' to trade options.  However that means massively outsized risk to your expected return; months of hard work can get f'd if you're 80% into deep ITM / less volatile options as a mid term investment.  And if I'm only using 20% of my acct for options generally, that means I can't do so much and income will be slow.  There's a reason people like spreads - for me its odds.  If a spread pays 1-2 and I have a 75% PoP, great, im there, usually til the end if its where I want/need.  Obviously there's exceptions, I closed TSLA 600/605 and 610/612.5 bull verts expiring x mas eve day on Wednesday, they were already at 95% max, and why take that risk?  Then, i say, do make some more speculative trades.  This dudes a gambler, and I love to gamble but even I wouldn't have these sorts of risk / reward scenarios as trades.  But, if you specialize- i mean really, every day every news piece etc. - you can be speculative and successful.  You'll lose sometimes of course, but the 2-500% of a gain makes up for it.  But at the very least I say go spreads where it's at least 50% max profit, and w the right movement, you can snag a 200% max spread w high confidence.  Ultimately though, its the long run that matters and if lots of small gains equals out then who cares? It's definitely just a gambling rush thing when ppl start shootin for the moon",

The stock market had a lot of smart people managing funds in it. They know the realistic timeline for the actual economy to get back and track. My prediction is things happen one of two ways.   A. The economy starts to recover as the vaccine reaches herd immunity levels, interest rates remain near 0 and companies take off in the biggest bull market ever seen in 2021 going into 2022.   B. The economy starts to recover, interest rates are raised as a result, housing and the stock market both ended a bear market for a year or two.   I guess c if we are gonna have a c would be a mixture of both. Economy recovers. Fed SLOWLY  raises interest rates causing a stagnant market eventually leading to a period of a bear market.

For example, if you buy 100 shares of Tesla for $500 and they go up to 1,000 but you don't sell, you owe no taxes. But, if you sell those 100 shares you owe taxes on the capital gain even if you never take the cash out of the trading account or immediately reinvest.

Tesla\u2019s CEO is a god damn rocket scientist. What other car company has the top engineering students lining up out the door to work for them? On top of all that. Tesla is a solar and home battery company. A technology company. Not a single business in the world could compete. I strongly believe Tesla will end up around $800 a share before the summer. No other car company is more exciting. On top of that they are now cash rich and can afford to out innovate the competition forever! Just like Apple. Look at an Apple. 2 trillion.

I wouldn't call that boring.  Probably it wouldn't be as fast as a Tesla, or have \"fart mode\", and a wide selection of options. But it would likely be more functional - the driving experience, the feature set, innovative small things I can't obviously predict etc. would be tuned to perfection. This assuming they could transfer their success in the past to car design, which is a big question.",
            "You are correct. P/E ratio doesn't matter for a rapidly growing company since they are constantly reinvesting in infrastructure and capital. They are watching their cash and actually having too high of earnings is a waste - they could have reinvested that money instead. When they \"level off\" and stop growing so fast (i.e. hopefully once they've captured a huge amount of market share), then they'll stop reinvesting so much cash and earnings will catch up to a normal profit margin, reaping the rewards of their growth at that point. Look at Amazon revenue vs profit as they grew:  https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/4298/amazons-long-term-growth/  What does still matter for a growing company though is P/S (price to sales). While they're growing, even if their profit (earnings) isn't high, the fact that they are growing should mean their top line sales (revenue) is growing like crazy. TSLA sales are growing very quickly, but their market cap has grown significantly faster, meaning they have a P/S ratio of almost 20. A normal S&amp;P 500 company has a P/S ratio of like 2. So we're pricing in an implied growth in sales of at least 10x from here. It sounds less horrendous than P/E 1,500 but I still think it's high. Tesla has a great headstart but there's LOTS of competition coming quickly from established players.",
            "To be fair Tesla are actually trying to innovate.  Apple gave up on all Innovation years ago.  You'd expect Tesla to have a much higher P/E",
            "P/E is an almost worthless figure compared to revenue for growth companies.  If Tesla\u2019s market cap based on its revenue was applied to Apple, Apple\u2019s market cap would be over $6 trillion. But Tesla is foremost an auto maker, and will likely never have anywhere close to Apple\u2019s big profit margins.  So Tesla is absurdly overvalued either way.",

Toyota sold 11M cars per year, Tesla 370k, something like 0.3% market share. If Tesla matched Toyota's unit sales (which would take 9-ish years at current rate of unit growth) - which I think is possible but unlikely - we're *still* looking at a valuation today representing about 3x revenue for what would be a mature company then.

First model s was launched in 2012, its been 8 years and even now, there aren\u2019t half decent equivalents from European car companies that can compete with the model s. Ever wondered why?   The meat behind electric cars is electronics, software and AI like self driving technology. Tesla was born in the part of the world that is the best at all of this. Europe is decades behind on AI, Machine learning compared to Silicon Valley, VW has no hopes of catching up to google/tesla with self driving tech. Silicon Valley is bloody good with electronics, Europe is not close. China is pretty close to Silicon Valley and that\u2019s why you see nio, xpeng etc get the hype.   Next VW is coming from China. Tesla is the Ford/GM of the 60s from the US. Europe is falling behind because all the core technologies required to make great electric cars are not their strengths.",

Those may be the future of the industry but it's not necessary to have in a car electric or otherwise. The real tech in an electric car is the battery pack. An electric motor is not changing anytime soon just like the ICE isn't either. Tesla's current batteries aren't very special either and they still don't have the capability to manufacture their own in quantity.   Tesla is like apple tho, they're selling a sexier version of an existing product (iphone vs flip phone). No one needed an iphone in 2007 when it came out, it was just super cool to have. It took a few years but every other manufacturer can make smartphones. If they can keep selling the tesla as a status symbol like apple then that's money but don't pretend they have some secret sauce.  Now if the battery day technology actually pans out then they would be decades ahead in battery tech but that's pretty out there.",

            "Well, you're not specifically asking anyone but here's what I've found to be good useful info:  If you trade for 5-10%, that's fine, if it works out long term. It's certainly the 'book way' to trade options.  However that means massively outsized risk to your expected return; months of hard work can get f'd if you're 80% into deep ITM / less volatile options as a mid term investment.  And if I'm only using 20% of my acct for options generally, that means I can't do so much and income will be slow.  There's a reason people like spreads - for me its odds.  If a spread pays 1-2 and I have a 75% PoP, great, im there, usually til the end if its where I want/need.  Obviously there's exceptions, I closed TSLA 600/605 and 610/612.5 bull verts expiring x mas eve day on Wednesday, they were already at 95% max, and why take that risk?  Then, i say, do make some more speculative trades.  This dudes a gambler, and I love to gamble but even I wouldn't have these sorts of risk / reward scenarios as trades.  But, if you specialize- i mean really, every day every news piece etc. - you can be speculative and successful.  You'll lose sometimes of course, but the 2-500% of a gain makes up for it.  But at the very least I say go spreads where it's at least 50% max profit, and w the right movement, you can snag a 200% max spread w high confidence.  Ultimately though, its the long run that matters and if lots of small gains equals out then who cares? It's definitely just a gambling rush thing when ppl start shootin for the moon",
