When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

Understand the most basic thing; **the squeeze WILL happen.**  People who keep saying it's today/Monday/Tuesday are just trying to get all the paper hand pussies and overthinking small capital bitches to pump, hastening the short. A typical good retard take would be that they are addicted to the rocket euphoria and don't want it to stop, I mean who wouldn't be? But the truth is flatlines is when people may start leaving, see AMD past few months and how much people want to fucking leave AMZN.   Speed of the short covering will heavily determine whether EOY stays at 20-22 or rockets to the fucking moon, because that's where all the useless FOMO mother fuckers will buy in.  If the squeeze keeps getting delayed, paper hands and your typical bitch tits will get manipulated and leave at small profit. The only way it gets rocket to the fucking moon by EOY without the short squeeze happening, is if Cohen announcing that he upped his stocks even more. Other paths to the moon without a short squeeze would be Q4 earnings report or announcement of ecommerce platform(or concretely working on it)",

I was a bitc01n maximalist for much of the last 8 years, though I did get lucky with AMD because I thought crypt0 had an outstretched effect on the market (Sell the shovels, and all that), I still just bought larger tech stocks (with a few exceptions) that I thought were \"safe\" since my less safe money was already in a crazy vehicle, I didn't want to be 100% YOLO.   I don't know if I'll find my next bitc01n/AMD/Chipotle, but when I sold TSLA I thought \"wait, large cap stocks aren't supposed to go parabolic this much this fast, right?\", and I've been used to TSLA correcting heavily for much of the last 7 years and the naysayers being slow to catch on (Hopefully it still does because I'm a long term believer and want back in haha).   Elon still made me some good cash, but I settled on Model S money, when I could have had new house money. Oh well. My appetite for losing hundreds of thousands of dollars went out the window in 2017.

I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

But the truth is flatlines is when people may start leaving, see AMD past few months and how much people want to fucking leave AMZN.   Speed of the short covering will heavily determine whether EOY stays at 20-22 or rockets to the fucking moon, because that's where all the useless FOMO mother fuckers will buy in.  If the squeeze keeps getting delayed, paper hands and your typical bitch tits will get manipulated and leave at small profit. The only way it gets rocket to the fucking moon by EOY without the short squeeze happening, is if Cohen announcing that he upped his stocks even more.

I was a bitc01n maximalist for much of the last 8 years, though I did get lucky with AMD because I thought crypt0 had an outstretched effect on the market (Sell the shovels, and all that), I still just bought larger tech stocks (with a few exceptions) that I thought were \"safe\" since my less safe money was already in a crazy vehicle, I didn't want to be 100% YOLO.   I don't know if I'll find my next bitc01n/AMD/Chipotle, but when I sold TSLA I thought \"wait, large cap stocks aren't supposed to go parabolic this much this fast, right?\", and I've been used to TSLA correcting heavily for much of the last 7 years and the naysayers being slow to catch on (Hopefully it still does because I'm a long term believer and want back in haha).   Elon still made me some good cash, but I settled on Model S money, when I could have had new house money. Oh well. My appetite for losing hundreds of thousands of dollars went out the window in 2017.

            "Last Year a lady hit the back of my car and totalled my car. The check that I received from her insurance company I decided to finally invest. A friend told me about Robinhood so I went and bought a google share and other vanguard for dividends. 1-2 months later, I installed reddit and joined r/stocks and investings and found out about r/wallstreetbets. This is where it became interesting. I would see peoples post of 700% gains, 2,000% gains. And I got so excited! So Without knowing anything about options, I bought my first Spy Call expiring in a week. That was when Covid happened and stock crashed. After I bought spy puts, it went back up and I started being happy. Bought RCL puts. Was happy my money was recovering. And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it. And lost it all recently buying PLTR Calls and it crashed. Anyways. Thats my story. Just had to vent and get it off my chest, its been bothering me for a really long time for being this autistic.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

            "Last Year a lady hit the back of my car and totalled my car. The check that I received from her insurance company I decided to finally invest. A friend told me about Robinhood so I went and bought a google share and other vanguard for dividends. 1-2 months later, I installed reddit and joined r/stocks and investings and found out about r/wallstreetbets. This is where it became interesting. I would see peoples post of 700% gains, 2,000% gains. And I got so excited! So Without knowing anything about options, I bought my first Spy Call expiring in a week. That was when Covid happened and stock crashed. After I bought spy puts, it went back up and I started being happy. Bought RCL puts. Was happy my money was recovering. And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it. And lost it all recently buying PLTR Calls and it crashed. Anyways. Thats my story. Just had to vent and get it off my chest, its been bothering me for a really long time for being this autistic.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

            "I have many different things working for me in different ways.   On example, Gilead has been is almost perfectly oppositely correlated to the market this year.  At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.   Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition. When the deal closes (likely in my view) the stock will trade up to the take out price and you\u2019ll get cash. Don\u2019t be stupid. Some deals are very very risky.

We aren\u2019t responsible for your decisions \u2014 and not everyone knows what they are talking about. In fact most don\u2019t. Any idiot can buy PLTR because it\u2019s trending on WSBs.

There\u2019s no substitute for hard work. If you don\u2019t have the time and inclination to do research, that\u2019s 100% okay too. Just buy an index and live your life. Don\u2019t gamble on stocks you aren\u2019t interested in learning about. Sometimes you will lose money, sometimes you will make money.   Even Amazon was down more than 80% at one point. All you can do is move forward. The market doesn\u2019t care about your cost basis. Just try to make smart, reasoned decisions and you\u2019ll be fine.

A friend told me about Robinhood so I went and bought a google share and other vanguard for dividends. 1-2 months later, I installed reddit and joined r/stocks and investings and found out about r/wallstreetbets. This is where it became interesting. I would see peoples post of 700% gains, 2,000% gains. And I got so excited! So Without knowing anything about options, I bought my first Spy Call expiring in a week. That was when Covid happened and stock crashed. After I bought spy puts, it went back up and I started being happy. Bought RCL puts. Was happy my money was recovering. And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it. And lost it all recently buying PLTR Calls and it crashed. Anyways. Thats my story. Just had to vent and get it off my chest, its been bothering me for a really long time for being this autistic.

            "Camping out in the bathroom at the family xmas party, so I figured what the hell.  My grandparents first opened a Edward Jones account for me at the age of 13 and bought me 10 shares of boomer $T. It wasn\u2019t until 16 or 17 that I actually cared enough to do anything with stocks. Somewhere there in high school I realized that real money could be made in the stock market. I had them put an additional 500$ of my money in and sold some $T to buy $GOOG. At this time goog was 750ish a share. I spent the next 4-5 years of my life buying boomer stocks and watching everything go up in the bull market.   I got introduced to Reddit in late 2018. Somewhere in 2019 I decided I wanted to get more active with my portfolio management and switch to a non-boomer platform, hence the creation of my robinhood account. I bought some more boomer stocks and I few other I did research on. In late 2019 I started discovering the financial side of Reddit. That is about the time I found this place that I now call home. I started using option about then, I had lost a good chunk on money(still a college student so like only a couple Gs) then March 2020 hit. Spy Puts were the best thing since sliced bread. Literally couldn\u2019t go tits up. Made some pretty good money, decided this option thing was really easy. I proceeded to lose most of that money in pump and dump stocks until about October. In October I called it quits. I decided I should probably learn my stuff. Since October I have had steady gains and now sit at +20% on the year after being down 75 at its worst.   It\u2019s been a wild ride. I graduate college in April with an 85k job lined up. I can\u2019t wait to get my big boy pants on an add another 0 or two to my account balance.  Peace out \u2018tards",
            "This story is believable, but the truth is in the details. Why $GOOG and not $GOOGL?",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes.

            "My background is in nanotechnology and mechanical engineering, with a brief stint in finance after school. I spent a little time on biomed (my thesis was actually about gene therapy nano particle vectoring for cystic fibrosis patients) but I love machines too so now work in manufacturing.  There are still 5,000-8,000 monogenic diseases out there. Of course we are not ready to begin human clinical trials on a wide scale but animal lab studies are in progress. Recently a Chinese researcher used CRISPR to edit the CCR5 gene out of human fetuses. Those children are now alive and immune to HIV (although it was an egregious ethical transgression in the eyes of most science professionals to do that without knowing the potential consequences or consulting the industry about human genetic editing ethical standards). Later got sued for it or something. Google the name He Jiankui. The point is public awareness and motivation for scientific experimentation around the technology are making big strides recently.   Individual genetic mutations do occur that can confound targeting and yes cas9 can make errors in site selection. Book-ending the active protein with cas9 instead of just one helps, as does appending RNA \u201chairpins\u201d to help with specific targeting. Those hairpins have been shown to 50x targeting accuracy (Thats off the top of my head, so don\u2019t quote me but I remember the figure I read was at least an order of magnitude increase). Also keep in mind in the future we will likely be able to sequence a patient\u2019s genome down to the base pairs and account for those unexpected discrepancies. There will be plenty of developmental and regulatory barriers along the way but that\u2019s the case for any new medical technology. Old school pharma fails in phase III 95% of the time too. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t rake it on on the products that actually go to market. I think this sector would behave similarly, but the ones that land will go way bigger way faster. Many small biotech shops you know of are struggling to do the same thing Pfizer does with similar technology and way less resources.

            "Last Year a lady hit the back of my car and totalled my car. The check that I received from her insurance company I decided to finally invest. A friend told me about Robinhood so I went and bought a google share and other vanguard for dividends. 1-2 months later, I installed reddit and joined r/stocks and investings and found out about r/wallstreetbets. This is where it became interesting. I would see peoples post of 700% gains, 2,000% gains. And I got so excited! So Without knowing anything about options, I bought my first Spy Call expiring in a week. That was when Covid happened and stock crashed. After I bought spy puts, it went back up and I started being happy. Bought RCL puts. Was happy my money was recovering. And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it. And lost it all recently buying PLTR Calls and it crashed. Anyways. Thats my story. Just had to vent and get it off my chest, its been bothering me for a really long time for being this autistic.

The shares plays went well. Of course my max investment in any of these was $4k. Still holding them all.   Continued to have success in excess of what the market was doing, pandemic dip be damned and thought hey, what the fuck - if my own picks are beating the market, why not bet on myself?  Articles about RH and WSB piqued my interest. Made a deposit 10/1 and am 4x now. PLTR and various ARK related picks to thank.

            "Camping out in the bathroom at the family xmas party, so I figured what the hell.  My grandparents first opened a Edward Jones account for me at the age of 13 and bought me 10 shares of boomer $T. It wasn\u2019t until 16 or 17 that I actually cared enough to do anything with stocks. Somewhere there in high school I realized that real money could be made in the stock market. I had them put an additional 500$ of my money in and sold some $T to buy $GOOG. At this time goog was 750ish a share. I spent the next 4-5 years of my life buying boomer stocks and watching everything go up in the bull market.   I got introduced to Reddit in late 2018. Somewhere in 2019 I decided I wanted to get more active with my portfolio management and switch to a non-boomer platform, hence the creation of my robinhood account. I bought some more boomer stocks and I few other I did research on. In late 2019 I started discovering the financial side of Reddit. That is about the time I found this place that I now call home. I started using option about then, I had lost a good chunk on money(still a college student so like only a couple Gs) then March 2020 hit. Spy Puts were the best thing since sliced bread. Literally couldn\u2019t go tits up. Made some pretty good money, decided this option thing was really easy. I proceeded to lose most of that money in pump and dump stocks until about October. In October I called it quits. I decided I should probably learn my stuff. Since October I have had steady gains and now sit at +20% on the year after being down 75 at its worst.   It\u2019s been a wild ride. I graduate college in April with an 85k job lined up. I can\u2019t wait to get my big boy pants on an add another 0 or two to my account balance.  Peace out \u2018tards",
            "This story is believable, but the truth is in the details. Why $GOOG and not $GOOGL?",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

            "My background is in nanotechnology and mechanical engineering, with a brief stint in finance after school. I spent a little time on biomed (my thesis was actually about gene therapy nano particle vectoring for cystic fibrosis patients) but I love machines too so now work in manufacturing.  There are still 5,000-8,000 monogenic diseases out there. Of course we are not ready to begin human clinical trials on a wide scale but animal lab studies are in progress. Recently a Chinese researcher used CRISPR to edit the CCR5 gene out of human fetuses. Those children are now alive and immune to HIV (although it was an egregious ethical transgression in the eyes of most science professionals to do that without knowing the potential consequences or consulting the industry about human genetic editing ethical standards). Later got sued for it or something. Google the name He Jiankui. The point is public awareness and motivation for scientific experimentation around the technology are making big strides recently.   Individual genetic mutations do occur that can confound targeting and yes cas9 can make errors in site selection. Book-ending the active protein with cas9 instead of just one helps, as does appending RNA \u201chairpins\u201d to help with specific targeting. Those hairpins have been shown to 50x targeting accuracy (Thats off the top of my head, so don\u2019t quote me but I remember the figure I read was at least an order of magnitude increase). Also keep in mind in the future we will likely be able to sequence a patient\u2019s genome down to the base pairs and account for those unexpected discrepancies. There will be plenty of developmental and regulatory barriers along the way but that\u2019s the case for any new medical technology. Old school pharma fails in phase III 95% of the time too. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t rake it on on the products that actually go to market. I think this sector would behave similarly, but the ones that land will go way bigger way faster. Many small biotech shops you know of are struggling to do the same thing Pfizer does with similar technology and way less resources. This is something entirely different  The main question for me is how long that will remain too cost prohibitive for widespread adoption.",

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

            "It's only a goal post move if you're a fucking retard with the critical thinking of a road kill nodding in agreememt to everything people say about $GME.  Understand the most basic thing; **the squeeze WILL happen.**  People who keep saying it's today/Monday/Tuesday are just trying to get all the paper hand pussies and overthinking small capital bitches to pump, hastening the short. A typical good retard take would be that they are addicted to the rocket euphoria and don't want it to stop, I mean who wouldn't be? But the truth is flatlines is when people may start leaving, see AMD past few months and how much people want to fucking leave AMZN.   Speed of the short covering will heavily determine whether EOY stays at 20-22 or rockets to the fucking moon, because that's where all the useless FOMO mother fuckers will buy in.  If the squeeze keeps getting delayed, paper hands and your typical bitch tits will get manipulated and leave at small profit. The only way it gets rocket to the fucking moon by EOY without the short squeeze happening, is if Cohen announcing that he upped his stocks even more. Other paths to the moon without a short squeeze would be Q4 earnings report or announcement of ecommerce platform(or concretely working on it)",

            "I have many different things working for me in different ways.   On example, Gilead has been is almost perfectly oppositely correlated to the market this year.  At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.   Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition. When the deal closes (likely in my view) the stock will trade up to the take out price and you\u2019ll get cash. Don\u2019t be stupid. Some deals are very very risky. Only invest in what you understand. There\u2019s always risk.  You just have to decide \u2014 is it risk that you can sleep with? Don\u2019t do anything without really understanding this question.   Take your time. There\u2019s no hurry. The trade will 95% still be there tomorrow or will come around again.  Do the work. Me, a stock broker, your brother\u2019s friend, and zillions of people on the Internet have stock picks ideas. We aren\u2019t responsible for your decisions \u2014 and not everyone knows what they are talking about. In fact most don\u2019t. Any idiot can buy PLTR because it\u2019s trending on WSBs. Do they really understand how governments buy their software, how they can grow, and how defensible their technology is?  Most people have no idea. You have to do research and read a lot. There\u2019s no substitute for hard work. If you don\u2019t have the time and inclination to do research, that\u2019s 100% okay too. Just buy an index and live your life. Don\u2019t gamble on stocks you aren\u2019t interested in learning about. Sometimes you will lose money, sometimes you will make money.   Even Amazon was down more than 80% at one point. All you can do is move forward. The market doesn\u2019t care about your cost basis. Just try to make smart, reasoned decisions and you\u2019ll be fine.

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

Understand the most basic thing; **the squeeze WILL happen.**  People who keep saying it's today/Monday/Tuesday are just trying to get all the paper hand pussies and overthinking small capital bitches to pump, hastening the short. A typical good retard take would be that they are addicted to the rocket euphoria and don't want it to stop, I mean who wouldn't be? But the truth is flatlines is when people may start leaving, see AMD past few months and how much people want to fucking leave AMZN.   Speed of the short covering will heavily determine whether EOY stays at 20-22 or rockets to the fucking moon, because that's where all the useless FOMO mother fuckers will buy in.  If the squeeze keeps getting delayed, paper hands and your typical bitch tits will get manipulated and leave at small profit. The only way it gets rocket to the fucking moon by EOY without the short squeeze happening, is if Cohen announcing that he upped his stocks even more. Other paths to the moon without a short squeeze would be Q4 earnings report or announcement of ecommerce platform(or concretely working on it)",

            "I have many different things working for me in different ways.   On example, Gilead has been is almost perfectly oppositely correlated to the market this year.  At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.   Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition. When the deal closes (likely in my view) the stock will trade up to the take out price and you\u2019ll get cash. Don\u2019t be stupid. Some deals are very very risky. Only invest in what you understand. There\u2019s always risk.  You just have to decide \u2014 is it risk that you can sleep with? Don\u2019t do anything without really understanding this question.   Take your time. There\u2019s no hurry. The trade will 95% still be there tomorrow or will come around again.  Do the work. Me, a stock broker, your brother\u2019s friend, and zillions of people on the Internet have stock picks ideas.

There\u2019s no substitute for hard work. If you don\u2019t have the time and inclination to do research, that\u2019s 100% okay too. Just buy an index and live your life. Don\u2019t gamble on stocks you aren\u2019t interested in learning about. Sometimes you will lose money, sometimes you will make money.   Even Amazon was down more than 80% at one point. All you can do is move forward. The market doesn\u2019t care about your cost basis. Just try to make smart, reasoned decisions and you\u2019ll be fine.

Fuck it - started paperhanding GME on November 17.   Became active in WSB late November/early December. I feel like a retard at home here.  Received hate on WSB for paperhanding GME. Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.  Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.   Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.   Price go up to $14.85. I wait for dip.  Price go up to $15.85. ***I wait for dip***.  Dip to $15.4. ***I FOMO hard YOLO in all my spare cash.***  Own 231 GME shares.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

Then \u2019rona hit. In the summer I found WSB but was too much pussy to start gambling.

At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months. Can't wait to see what 2021 will bring, definitely holding everything right now (diamond hand gang).",

            "I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the female members of this group. The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend. Hopefully this clears a few things up with the more disgruntled members of the group.",

            "So here\u2019s what I think about timing the Market and the conventional wisdom surrounding it-  Let\u2019s look at last March, for instance, markets dropped about 35% from feb 20 to mar 20.  My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.   I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I\u2019ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year.   Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it\u2019s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options).   Thank you, and have a Merry Christmas.  I digress.",

Buy quality stocks when others \u201cfeel\u201d scared.  Commentators love to talk about how they feel about the market. Don\u2019t care about good or bad feelings.  Healthy companies with little debt will continue to operate and innovate in market decline.    Consider Microsoft as an example: A stock market decline has very little impact on Microsoft\u2019s future with massive profit margins, tons of cash, boatloads of optionality as they ride a growing wave of cloud computing and digital tools.   Yet you could have bought Microsoft in the mid-$100s in February / March 2020. Yeah, the recovery was somewhat unexpectedly quick. But, some idiots sold Microsoft in the mid-$100s. Others  bought the dip. Know the names that you want to get into and have the cash ready.  You likely won\u2019t pick the bottom \u2014 that requires dumb luck \u2014 but a sale is a sale.  Then hold through the recovery and for the long term. Some companies like Microsoft need to get bigger.  They have to. They produce too much cash and therefore they must do ALL of the following: invest internally on long term R&amp;D bets, invest internally on nimble short-term opportunities, buy more companies to grow revenue and profits, give capital back to shareholders with dividend increases, and buy back stock.   What else are they going to do? They are going to get bigger. Hopefully, if they continue to be smart and focused, the stock price will weigh them as more valuable.",

Knew about WSB from a few YouTube videos where they talked badly about you autists, but wasn't being active in the sub, or even lurking back then.   My europoor broker app (Revolut) only allows buying and selling of shares. I figured good, because at least I won't gamble my money away on retarded YOLO plays like those WSB autists.  Bought my first stock (HAS) on August 14 2020.  Tried boomervesting, owning 69.4209001 diversified ass shares. After 1.5 months, made $5 profit on a $1000 investment. Fuck that shit. Sold everything off.  Knew about GME stock at that time, cuz I saw Michael Bury owning bigly shares. Become obsessed.    ***\"Why does Big Short guy own this dying company?\"***    Did a detailed DD on my own, back in September, before I even knew this sub was slowly getting obsessed with the same stock I was getting obsessed with.  Became a GME believer right then and there, months before joining WSB. Didn't have the balls to go all in. Fucking idiot. Fucking moron.  Tried the REGN Trump pump. Lost money.   Fuck it - started paperhanding GME on November 17.   Became active in WSB late November/early December. I feel like a retard at home here.  Received hate on WSB for paperhanding GME. Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.  Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.   Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.   Price go up to $14.85. I wait for dip.  Price go up to $15.85. ***I wait for dip***.  Dip to $15.4. ***I FOMO hard YOLO in all my spare cash.***  Own 231 GME shares.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months.

            "I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the female members of this group. The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend. Hopefully this clears a few things up with the more disgruntled members of the group.",

            "So here\u2019s what I think about timing the Market and the conventional wisdom surrounding it-  Let\u2019s look at last March, for instance, markets dropped about 35% from feb 20 to mar 20.  My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.   I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I\u2019ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year.   Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it\u2019s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options).

            "Yes. Markets generally go down faster than they go up.  Go look at a chart of the SPY (S&amp;P 500). There are always corrections. Buy quality stocks when others \u201cfeel\u201d scared.  Commentators love to talk about how they feel about the market. Don\u2019t care about good or bad feelings.  Healthy companies with little debt will continue to operate and innovate in market decline.    Consider Microsoft as an example: A stock market decline has very little impact on Microsoft\u2019s future with massive profit margins, tons of cash, boatloads of optionality as they ride a growing wave of cloud computing and digital tools.   Yet you could have bought Microsoft in the mid-$100s in February / March 2020. Yeah, the recovery was somewhat unexpectedly quick. But, some idiots sold Microsoft in the mid-$100s. Others  bought the dip. Know the names that you want to get into and have the cash ready.  You likely won\u2019t pick the bottom \u2014 that requires dumb luck \u2014 but a sale is a sale.  Then hold through the recovery and for the long term. Some companies like Microsoft need to get bigger.  They have to. They produce too much cash and therefore they must do ALL of the following: invest internally on long term R&amp;D bets, invest internally on nimble short-term opportunities, buy more companies to grow revenue and profits, give capital back to shareholders with dividend increases, and buy back stock.   What else are they going to do? They are going to get bigger. Hopefully, if they continue to be smart and focused, the stock price will weigh them as more valuable.",
            "Scenarios 1 and 4 are highly unlikely. Maybe a 5% chance. Scenario 2 or 3 will most likely happen. As for as market cap: GME P/S is .2 at the moment. Comparable b&amp;m retailers like BBY are .6 P/S. That puts GME around $60 a share or $3B market cap.",
            "That depends entirely on your financial situation and your ability as an investor. It makes sense that someone like Warren Buffet holds a surplus of cash and looks for a good buying opportunity. Use the  S&amp;P 500 as your benchmark.

Today I'm saying \"fuck, GME might actually be a 2022 play too, if this and that happens...\"  So, Occam's Razor makes it perfectly plausible our beloved jacker has figured \"hey, I can actually make more money here in the short term, then come back later to GME and own even more shares\"  I haven't looked too deep into it cuz I can't be truly bothered, but somebody commented somewhere that, based on the interesting event timeline this week, he might've actually lost out on a hefty chunk of the recent GME gains, between the $16-$20 price point. So, even if he did truly pump and dump, he chose the worst possible moment to do so, so I guess that would be karma or sumshit, I dunno...  u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT you can join in on this drama at any point mate so we can hear your side of the story.  #",

            "I started trading back in 2012. Save up money from a part time job and invested it in apple. Basically invested about $20k into it over a few years. However, it was also my emergency fund and I\u2019d periodically take money out to pay for shit. Fast forward to this year I have about 35k. March happens I sold my positions and was left with ~30k. Started reinvesting in some stocks I liked when a friend put me onto WSB. Saw the crazy gains and went spy calls for ez money. Doubled my 29k to 58k. Then June happened and my spy calls got fucked. Lost 18k. Pulled my money out and stopped trading for like a month or two. I was still up but I was also pretty devastated. Realized it\u2019s not easy money and I needed to be smarter. I eventually bought back into just stocks and started buying leaps. Sitting at 75k right now. I don\u2019t have the crazy gains that you see here but I also don\u2019t have the crazy losses either. Trading is hard and even when you\u2019re right you won\u2019t necessarily make money. Personally don\u2019t chase the crazy gains because for every retard becoming a millionaire there\u2019s tons of others losing their shirt. Good luck and Merry Christmas.",

Ford never really panned out, but Chevron did and I/we sold around $30 profit/share. When I turned 18 is when I hopped on robinhood, made some gains here and there buying low and selling high on some small company stocks.   I was in Engineering in college but then decided it wasn\u2019t my thing, switched to a Supply Chain major which involved taking a shitload of Accounting, Finance, Management, and etc type classes where I learned a bit about Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Risk Management. Made a rookie move back in March and sold as soon as I heard COVID was coming, didn\u2019t buy back in either (I was holding Tesla and Apple, for some reason turned bearish). Learned my lesson from that. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research/analysis and picking options without putting any actual money in them because losing a few hundred is devastating to a college student and I\u2019m not as ballsy as some of you fuckers.

            "Buying AAPL since I turned 20 and found out what a stock was.  My 20s and early 30s were spent on some Motley Fool subscriptions which actually have reasonable DD and were responsible for some serious gains over the years.  Then I got Robinhood in mid 2018 and the ducking wheels came off the car once I got deep into options. 2018-2019 was a gold rush, man. Flipping calls for 100% overnight (had I held any of those leaps I would have been looking at 2000+% now... live and learn!) and trading in the AM while the dog shits on neighbour\u2019s lawns.  2020 was the year of theta plays for me, and it\u2019s been pretty good so far. About $100k gain (50% return on cash) and potentially another $50k next week if $ABNB can get its pump on back to $165 for me.  Maybe once the world is sane again I\u2019ll start spending and enjoying this money, but until then keep stacking it up.  ALWAYS TAKE PROFITS!

Traded 3x long VIX in 2018, made a few thousand going all in a few times and quickly lost everything in one trade (Actually went negative).   Six years later and it was the cheapest education ever. Only ever lost $120 and now I've realized enough to pay my tuition and still have 20k of house money to play around with.",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

Only ever lost $120 and now I've realized enough to pay my tuition and still have 20k of house money to play around with.",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

You get the feeling that you're talking with an aficionado, or a sommelier when picking out wines. And then there's the fact that they are shifting to more of an online focus.   But really what does it for me is that they currently have assets on hand valued at over $2.8B when the current market cap is $1.4B.   Once they finish getting whipped into shape, the increased revenues and then profits will show that a higher market cap is warranted."

Also more traditional companies like Visa are still dominant in global payments and will benefit from the trend. Conviction buys on SQ PYPL especially   AI/Robotics/automation: my main AI buy was c3.ai right at IPO open. Companies like NVDA IBM google and twilio have AI units but they\u2019re not pure play AI. ServiceNow (enterprise software) has been acquiring AI firms too. I like alteryx for AI but not as much these days. There just aren\u2019t many pure play AI public tickers so I do lean on ETFs here. For robotics: intuitive surgical is the gold standard but has cooled off recently, but teradyne is my conviction buy there. Automation ADSK is #1. Rockwell automation. Most of these companies are somewhat involved in more than one of the sectors I mentioned so the lines get blurry.   Telemedicine: TDOC more sustained value, M3 for potential rocket   Genomics: CRSP, EDIT, NTLA (this last one hasn\u2019t popped as hard yet so good time to enter, room to run)  Cybersecurity: NET, CRWD  3D printing: stratasys   IoT I don\u2019t really have a good single ticker. I have a ton of ETFs like WCLD, SNSR, etc. BOTZ, there are many many ETFs in these sectors you could look up the holdings if you want to dig deeer"

First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL).

            "I had a fart related encounter at Big Five with an absolute Joker today.   I have always had explosive gas, mostly by choice. My father was a plumber by trade, flatulist by hoppy...made sense considering the smells he had to whiff in his line of work. Taught me how to control my gas from an early age, and I supplement this control with a ghstly diet. Find it's a good way of putting people in their place.....   Anyway I'm at Big Five near Los Angeles, CA... The pandemic is getting really bad here and the gov is about to bang up everybody in their homes....while I'm minding my own business trying to buy a gun and not spread the plague a man walks in....no mask on.   The scrawny kid up front tells John Wayne he'll need to wear a mask. \"Really?\" asks the duke incredulously as he sashays over to the fishing section.   Scrawny clearly doesn't know how to handle him but I do. I was locked and loaded, with a gut full of bananas dipped in salsa, milk, and Bush's pinto beans...my stomach was a scud missile and the duke was lookin like a saudi base.   I strolled over to John as he drooled over a fishing rod. We were back to back but I could see his reflection in my glasses. I waited patiently for my quarry to turn around. As soon I saw his floppy mug I let loose.   For about two seconds a sound somewhere between a shotgun blast and a hog revving roared through the store.   I spun around in case Marion tried to sucker punch me...to me relief I didn't feel any stool in my man panties. He looked shocked and angry, like a haughty cat sprayed with water.   We locked eyes like a couple of rams about to duel, and then the gas wafted up to his face. His lips warped into a terrible rictus and he turned tail...I think he said \"Jesus Christ\" as he scampered off.   He hopped in his plush F-150 and sped away never to return to Big Five... Didn't want to wear a mask to stop a virus...couldn't handle a little ass blast. Real tough guy.",

I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "I had a fart related encounter at Big Five with an absolute Joker today.   I have always had explosive gas, mostly by choice. My father was a plumber by trade, flatulist by hoppy...made sense considering the smells he had to whiff in his line of work. Taught me how to control my gas from an early age, and I supplement this control with a ghstly diet. Find it's a good way of putting people in their place.....   Anyway I'm at Big Five near Los Angeles, CA... The pandemic is getting really bad here and the gov is about to bang up everybody in their homes....while I'm minding my own business trying to buy a gun and not spread the plague a man walks in....no mask on.   The scrawny kid up front tells John Wayne he'll need to wear a mask. \"Really?\" asks the duke incredulously as he sashays over to the fishing section.   Scrawny clearly doesn't know how to handle him but I do. I was locked and loaded, with a gut full of bananas dipped in salsa, milk, and Bush's pinto beans...my stomach was a scud missile and the duke was lookin like a saudi base.   I strolled over to John as he drooled over a fishing rod. We were back to back but I could see his reflection in my glasses. I waited patiently for my quarry to turn around. As soon I saw his floppy mug I let loose.   For about two seconds a sound somewhere between a shotgun blast and a hog revving roared through the store.   I spun around in case Marion tried to sucker punch me...to me relief I didn't feel any stool in my man panties. He looked shocked and angry, like a haughty cat sprayed with water.   We locked eyes like a couple of rams about to duel, and then the gas wafted up to his face. His lips warped into a terrible rictus and he turned tail...I think he said \"Jesus Christ\" as he scampered off.   He hopped in his plush F-150 and sped away never to return to Big Five... Didn't want to wear a mask to stop a virus...couldn't handle a little ass blast. Real tough guy.",
            "I took a bunch of molly earlier because fuck it why not. Home rolling with the cat",
            "BABA bulls are very silly.  Play the dead cat bounce on Monday if you want.  Don\u2019t play long term.  The CCP is not to be trifled with, they are consolidating power under Xi and any dissension is going to be swiftly stamped out.",
            "I was going nuts trying to find the track to that meme with the head bobbing cat, mango, and buyden on the drums. It led me to a video of a homely farm girl absolutely tearing her backyard dance floor up using leeks as batons. That then led me to some rando anime sloot someone animated doing the same thing. with animated leeks.   &amp;#x200B;  Man the internet is a strange and beautiful place",
            "Sorry. I had to feed my cat. I still love you either way bro. You should know more than I do that going to school has nothing to do with what you know. Come on dude.",
            "Cut your losses. Maybe you'll see a slight dead cat bounce net week. Do not get your hopes up. Get out. Hard to see China not dragging this out for an extended period of time.",

When Buffett/BRK started getting into KO, it was 1) one of the best brands on earth 2) growing worldwide 3) throwing off a div 4) Somewhat beaten down in price relative to the gleam of its actual business perspective after the Cola Wars and the \"New Coke\" disaster of the 1980s; an AMAZING choice to park large wads of cash for both direct return and potential growth upside. His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE?

            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).",

            "My background is in nanotechnology and mechanical engineering, with a brief stint in finance after school. I spent a little time on biomed (my thesis was actually about gene therapy nano particle vectoring for cystic fibrosis patients) but I love machines too so now work in manufacturing.  There are still 5,000-8,000 monogenic diseases out there. Of course we are not ready to begin human clinical trials on a wide scale but animal lab studies are in progress. Recently a Chinese researcher used CRISPR to edit the CCR5 gene out of human fetuses. Those children are now alive and immune to HIV (although it was an egregious ethical transgression in the eyes of most science professionals to do that without knowing the potential consequences or consulting the industry about human genetic editing ethical standards). Later got sued for it or something. Google the name He Jiankui. The point is public awareness and motivation for scientific experimentation around the technology are making big strides recently.   Individual genetic mutations do occur that can confound targeting and yes cas9 can make errors in site selection. Book-ending the active protein with cas9 instead of just one helps, as does appending RNA \u201chairpins\u201d to help with specific targeting. Those hairpins have been shown to 50x targeting accuracy (Thats off the top of my head, so don\u2019t quote me but I remember the figure I read was at least an order of magnitude increase). Also keep in mind in the future we will likely be able to sequence a patient\u2019s genome down to the base pairs and account for those unexpected discrepancies. There will be plenty of developmental and regulatory barriers along the way but that\u2019s the case for any new medical technology. Old school pharma fails in phase III 95% of the time too. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t rake it on on the products that actually go to market. I think this sector would behave similarly, but the ones that land will go way bigger way faster. Many small biotech shops you know of are struggling to do the same thing Pfizer does with similar technology and way less resources. This is something entirely different  The main question for me is how long that will remain too cost prohibitive for widespread adoption.",

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.

My thesis is that the last country in the world with a health system that prints money in terms of profiting is nearing its end. Intuitive surgical will have to change the way they design their equipment, and offer way more support to legacy systems to thrive once the music stops.  for example, Intuitive no longer offers GI staple loads for their older surgical robots, a very VERY interval part to some cases, essentially forcing facilities into buying the newer models that cost millions of dollars, just so they can keep doing the procedures that had been doing previously.   Ive never seen that sort of product discontinuation around any other clip or staple load, or stapler in this job, because if Ethicon says they're not going to make a lap staple anymore, or discontinue support, a facility can turn around and do business with 5 other competitors.

None of it was his work.  Everytime something bad happens, it becomes apparent they were lying about everything. When their deal with GM started to unravel, we all got to see that they needed GM to not only produce the Badger, but provide all the battery and engine technology because they didn't have any. When the garbage truck deal fell through, it is again apparent that they lied about their capabilities. There are other companies already making electric garbage trucks, so it's not like it's some impossible dream. Nikola just isn't capable of it.

            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).",
            "I'm using schwab and started doing vertical credit put spreads to generate some cash.

            "My background is in nanotechnology and mechanical engineering, with a brief stint in finance after school. I spent a little time on biomed (my thesis was actually about gene therapy nano particle vectoring for cystic fibrosis patients) but I love machines too so now work in manufacturing.  There are still 5,000-8,000 monogenic diseases out there. Of course we are not ready to begin human clinical trials on a wide scale but animal lab studies are in progress. Recently a Chinese researcher used CRISPR to edit the CCR5 gene out of human fetuses. Those children are now alive and immune to HIV (although it was an egregious ethical transgression in the eyes of most science professionals to do that without knowing the potential consequences or consulting the industry about human genetic editing ethical standards). Later got sued for it or something. Google the name He Jiankui. The point is public awareness and motivation for scientific experimentation around the technology are making big strides recently.   Individual genetic mutations do occur that can confound targeting and yes cas9 can make errors in site selection. Book-ending the active protein with cas9 instead of just one helps, as does appending RNA \u201chairpins\u201d to help with specific targeting. Those hairpins have been shown to 50x targeting accuracy (Thats off the top of my head, so don\u2019t quote me but I remember the figure I read was at least an order of magnitude increase). Also keep in mind in the future we will likely be able to sequence a patient\u2019s genome down to the base pairs and account for those unexpected discrepancies. There will be plenty of developmental and regulatory barriers along the way but that\u2019s the case for any new medical technology. Old school pharma fails in phase III 95% of the time too. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t rake it on on the products that actually go to market. I think this sector would behave similarly, but the ones that land will go way bigger way faster. Many small biotech shops you know of are struggling to do the same thing Pfizer does with similar technology and way less resources. This is something entirely different  The main question for me is how long that will remain too cost prohibitive for widespread adoption.",

Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.

            "I have many different things working for me in different ways.   On example, Gilead has been is almost perfectly oppositely correlated to the market this year.  At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.   Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition. When the deal closes (likely in my view) the stock will trade up to the take out price and you\u2019ll get cash. Don\u2019t be stupid. Some deals are very very risky. Only invest in what you understand. There\u2019s always risk.  You just have to decide \u2014 is it risk that you can sleep with? Don\u2019t do anything without really understanding this question.   Take your time. There\u2019s no hurry. The trade will 95% still be there tomorrow or will come around again.  Do the work. Me, a stock broker, your brother\u2019s friend, and zillions of people on the Internet have stock picks ideas. We aren\u2019t responsible for your decisions \u2014 and not everyone knows what they are talking about. In fact most don\u2019t. Any idiot can buy PLTR because it\u2019s trending on WSBs.

There\u2019s no substitute for hard work. If you don\u2019t have the time and inclination to do research, that\u2019s 100% okay too. Just buy an index and live your life. Don\u2019t gamble on stocks you aren\u2019t interested in learning about. Sometimes you will lose money, sometimes you will make money.   Even Amazon was down more than 80% at one point. All you can do is move forward. The market doesn\u2019t care about your cost basis. Just try to make smart, reasoned decisions and you\u2019ll be fine.

My thesis is that the last country in the world with a health system that prints money in terms of profiting is nearing its end. Intuitive surgical will have to change the way they design their equipment, and offer way more support to legacy systems to thrive once the music stops.  for example, Intuitive no longer offers GI staple loads for their older surgical robots, a very VERY interval part to some cases, essentially forcing facilities into buying the newer models that cost millions of dollars, just so they can keep doing the procedures that had been doing previously.   Ive never seen that sort of product discontinuation around any other clip or staple load, or stapler in this job, because if Ethicon says they're not going to make a lap staple anymore, or discontinue support, a facility can turn around and do business with 5 other competitors. Intuitive is a monopoly, and abusing the LIVING fuck out of it that surpasses greed.",

None of it was his work.  Everytime something bad happens, it becomes apparent they were lying about everything. When their deal with GM started to unravel, we all got to see that they needed GM to not only produce the Badger, but provide all the battery and engine technology because they didn't have any. When the garbage truck deal fell through, it is again apparent that they lied about their capabilities. There are other companies already making electric garbage trucks, so it's not like it's some impossible dream. Nikola just isn't capable of it.

They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics."

            "I started trading (as an on-the-side thing, I\u2019ve always had a full-time job) in 2016. I probably was pretty much flat from 2016 to this year. I tried a bunch of different things and strategies, etc. and I\u2019d go up a bunch then down a bunch and over three years probably was just even.  I started making a lot more in salary though and this year really put a lot in my brokerage and found that the secret to making money in the market is having money. This year I\u2019ve done really well and it\u2019s because I have set goals, abide by them, and if something goes sideways, I don\u2019t stress because no one trade makes up too much of my account.  Three years ago because I had less, I would dedicate too much to just a few trades and if the market turned I was stuck. I didn\u2019t want to sell at huge losses but I also then didn\u2019t have any money to trade with. That led to a lot of stress and emotional (and therefore bad) decisions.  Now if something goes against me, I can just let it sit until it recovers and go about my business. I can stay calm and make rational decisions instead of desperate decisions, and that (plus a crazy bull market...) has made all the difference.",
            "I started trading back in 2012. Save up money from a part time job and invested it in apple. Basically invested about $20k into it over a few years. However, it was also my emergency fund and I\u2019d periodically take money out to pay for shit. Fast forward to this year I have about 35k. March happens I sold my positions and was left with ~30k. Started reinvesting in some stocks I liked when a friend put me onto WSB. Saw the crazy gains and went spy calls for ez money. Doubled my 29k to 58k. Then June happened and my spy calls got fucked. Lost 18k. Pulled my money out and stopped trading for like a month or two. I was still up but I was also pretty devastated. Realized it\u2019s not easy money and I needed to be smarter. I eventually bought back into just stocks and started buying leaps. Sitting at 75k right now. I don\u2019t have the crazy gains that you see here but I also don\u2019t have the crazy losses either. Trading is hard and even when you\u2019re right you won\u2019t necessarily make money.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",
            "I\u2019m new to the market and am here to get ideas on what to do and what not to do. I started trading December 1 with an amount that I am comfortable with losing, the idea being that I\u2019m likely going to do something completely retarded and lose it all. Thus far am up 64% (mostly on calls) but have not jumped on any of the WSB gravy trains. Trying to train myself against the FOMO of that and against getting so confident with a 64% return that I\u2019d dump a lot more into the market before I have a stronger grasp of what the fuck is going on.",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",
            "This year around a few days before the crash. I don\u2019t know if I just saw something on the news regarding said crash or what but I had this urge to want to start a portfolio.  Took about a month before I was actually approved to begin trading and put in $300 in a few Delta and AMD shares. Sold those for a minor profit.  And during that time a lot of posts from here would pop up occasionally in popular for me as I browsed so I\u2019d lurk around confused about what it was about. The memes really drew me in though.  Learned about options and lost all of my gains. Until recently when I saw the DD post of PLTR while it was at $15. I said fuck it and deposit what I had in my savings to buy shares and leaps.  Aaaand. Now we\u2019re here. Got $2k profit so far so that\u2019s kinda cool.

Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week.

My parents think I have my money still and I have not spoke to any friends in months. I never thought I\u2019d let myself get this far down everyday since July 24th I wake up at 7 and watch the market until close and have done nothing but not trust my gut and it\u2019s fucked me over.   And I\u2019m at my last leg of desperation, my dealer offered to buy my car back 15-18k and I\u2019m gonna sell it. Deposit all of it in RH, turn on margin and start trading.

Figured it'd be a solid investment and sure had a lot of hype around it.   Well.. not sure if anyone's familiar with how that massive pump and dump went.. but I can still remember thinking how much of a genius I was for getting in at $22/share when it spiked above $200. Only to watch it go down about $100 in a single day. What a great introduction to how MM manipulate the fuck out of the market \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
            "Started on March 15th this year with $5k. Bought puts during the dip and was up $500 or so and then things started turning around. I got caught up in diamond hands and rode it down to $2200.   I then started trying to make it back on earnings plays and things that should work (but never do), like shorting the entire country of Italy. I was making it back but slowly. So I deposited another $5k and caught some VIX DD from /u/dlkdev and bought some calls that worked out. That took me back up over $10K - all the way to $12.5k.  It's at this point I told my wife about all of this and bought her a new oven.  Then I went back in with $10K and got caught up in clang gang which was a loser. Down to about $5K now and all in on GME.  I have another account I use for more theta-gang strategies and I'm up about $7K for the year there, so overall up about $4K for the year so feeling pretty good.  I made ~500 trades across three or four brokerages (RH, TW, Fidelity, Vanguard) so I'm going to hate tax time.  Also, Vanguard is surprisingly nice for trading options. Who'd have thought?",

Then the Dot.com bubble happened in 1999, and I was in everything tech... but my lucky fiscal moment happened as I read comments from Todd Harrison, who was the head trader at Jim Cramer's hedge fund, Cramer-Berkowicz. Todd said the market was the most overvalued he'd ever seen, that he was short up to his boxers,  so I sold everything the day before I left town for a creative writers conference. The next day the NASDAQ drilled 600 points. And it continued falling. l used the money I'd saved to live off of for a year and wrote a novel, which brought me $60,000 in tendies. l started back trading again in 2007. Overtraded like a spastic retard for six years, paperhanding everything and sending great gobs of commission dollars to Scottrade, whose manager actually called and thanked me for transferring so many tendies out of my account and into his firm's profit ledger. Today l daytrade a mid 5-figure account and am up 12% this year (lotsa 60DTE options) while penning my next novel, \"Bonfire of the Autists.\"",

            "36 y/o teacher looking to get rich since I\u2019ve plateaued income-wise. I started in early 2018 when I saw you motherfuckers talking about yachts. When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",

The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

If you also made $10,000 in gains in 2021, then you wouldn\u2019t have to pay taxes on the $10,000 because you still have the carryover losses. This assumes the loss / gain are of same type ( short or long ). You can still deduct the $3,000 because you still have $20,000 in losses. In 2022, you\u2019d have $17,000 of carried over losses. If In 2022, if you gained $20,000 then you\u2019d have to pay taxes only on $3000.  TLDR : Not a tax professional but if you have losses, you should be able to offset them with gains in following years.",

            "So here\u2019s what I think about timing the Market and the conventional wisdom surrounding it-  Let\u2019s look at last March, for instance, markets dropped about 35% from feb 20 to mar 20.  My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.   I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I\u2019ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year.   Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it\u2019s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options).   Thank you, and have a Merry Christmas.  I digress.",

Yet you could have bought Microsoft in the mid-$100s in February / March 2020. Yeah, the recovery was somewhat unexpectedly quick. But, some idiots sold Microsoft in the mid-$100s. Others  bought the dip. Know the names that you want to get into and have the cash ready.  You likely won\u2019t pick the bottom \u2014 that requires dumb luck \u2014 but a sale is a sale.  Then hold through the recovery and for the long term. Some companies like Microsoft need to get bigger.  They have to. They produce too much cash and therefore they must do ALL of the following: invest internally on long term R&amp;D bets, invest internally on nimble short-term opportunities, buy more companies to grow revenue and profits, give capital back to shareholders with dividend increases, and buy back stock.   What else are they going to do? They are going to get bigger. Hopefully, if they continue to be smart and focused, the stock price will weigh them as more valuable.",

I tried a bunch of different things and strategies, etc. and I\u2019d go up a bunch then down a bunch and over three years probably was just even.  I started making a lot more in salary though and this year really put a lot in my brokerage and found that the secret to making money in the market is having money. This year I\u2019ve done really well and it\u2019s because I have set goals, abide by them, and if something goes sideways, I don\u2019t stress because no one trade makes up too much of my account.  Three years ago because I had less, I would dedicate too much to just a few trades and if the market turned I was stuck. I didn\u2019t want to sell at huge losses but I also then didn\u2019t have any money to trade with. That led to a lot of stress and emotional (and therefore bad) decisions.  Now if something goes against me, I can just let it sit until it recovers and go about my business. I can stay calm and make rational decisions instead of desperate decisions, and that (plus a crazy bull market...) has made all the difference.",

Lost 18k. Pulled my money out and stopped trading for like a month or two. I was still up but I was also pretty devastated. Realized it\u2019s not easy money and I needed to be smarter. I eventually bought back into just stocks and started buying leaps. Sitting at 75k right now. I don\u2019t have the crazy gains that you see here but I also don\u2019t have the crazy losses either.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing.

The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

This assumes the loss / gain are of same type ( short or long ). You can still deduct the $3,000 because you still have $20,000 in losses. In 2022, you\u2019d have $17,000 of carried over losses. If In 2022, if you gained $20,000 then you\u2019d have to pay taxes only on $3000.

            "So here\u2019s what I think about timing the Market and the conventional wisdom surrounding it-  Let\u2019s look at last March, for instance, markets dropped about 35% from feb 20 to mar 20.  My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.   I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I\u2019ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year.   Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it\u2019s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options).   Thank you, and have a Merry Christmas.  I digress.",

Plus I can sell an occasional FD (guess I could have with 100 shares too, but I don't like all my long assets tied up in case things go wrong).  TSLA is a bit more difficult because it's expensive. Right now I'm leveraged on MSFT about 4x the delta if have with shares alone. $25k position could buy about 113 shares, or a 113 delta. I think I have June leaps right now that total up to about a 500 delta. IV has been low, so I leveraged up just in time.  Merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84",

Buy quality stocks when others \u201cfeel\u201d scared.  Commentators love to talk about how they feel about the market. Don\u2019t care about good or bad feelings.  Healthy companies with little debt will continue to operate and innovate in market decline.    Consider Microsoft as an example: A stock market decline has very little impact on Microsoft\u2019s future with massive profit margins, tons of cash, boatloads of optionality as they ride a growing wave of cloud computing and digital tools.   Yet you could have bought Microsoft in the mid-$100s in February / March 2020. Yeah, the recovery was somewhat unexpectedly quick. But, some idiots sold Microsoft in the mid-$100s. Others  bought the dip. Know the names that you want to get into and have the cash ready.  You likely won\u2019t pick the bottom \u2014 that requires dumb luck \u2014 but a sale is a sale.  Then hold through the recovery and for the long term. Some companies like Microsoft need to get bigger.  They have to. They produce too much cash and therefore they must do ALL of the following: invest internally on long term R&amp;D bets, invest internally on nimble short-term opportunities, buy more companies to grow revenue and profits, give capital back to shareholders with dividend increases, and buy back stock.   What else are they going to do? They are going to get bigger. Hopefully, if they continue to be smart and focused, the stock price will weigh them as more valuable.",

North America is basically doomed at this point, your leaders have sold you all out and I give it 50 years tops in the best case scenario, before it becomes nothing but a Chinese proxy.

I had known about DraftKings for years and thought it was an absolute beast of a company. Full ATM machine/ print money at will. Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early.

Took a break just adding to my account for the next year holding shit stonks until I got up to 8k and started options again but smaller positions.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone.

When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account.

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",
            "Nah dude, the MOASS is still, like, a 5% likely to happen kind of event. Too many variables and uncertainty at play for this thing to reach boiling point that easily. A month ago, when I first invested in GME, the whole uber-squeeze scenario did not make sense to me. The big players like Melvin Capital and BofA do not just let themselves get fucked over easily like that, they've got loads of ways, connections and ammo to bid their time and exit at breakeven or even minor profit.  What is quite likely, is this TSLA scenario, where we slowly burn up and up for weeks and months next year, as long as a constant stream of new positive catalysts hits the news every few days and the overall sentiment keeps slowly, but surely shifting from \"HAR HAR Blockbuster bankruptcy\" to \"well I'll be damned, they're actually turning this around...\"  Then, we might hit those $60+ price targets, which, even now, for most people would be a 3x at least.",

            "The shelf offering of $100 million is less than 5 million shares at current price. It was 6.25 million shares back when the price was $16.   Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.  So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.  I do share at least some of the \"sell before earnings\" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.  But, the losing money argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores.  Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).  If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.  Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.     It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.",

North America is basically doomed at this point, your leaders have sold you all out and I give it 50 years tops in the best case scenario, before it becomes nothing but a Chinese proxy.

Intuitive surgical will have to change the way they design their equipment, and offer way more support to legacy systems to thrive once the music stops.  for example, Intuitive no longer offers GI staple loads for their older surgical robots, a very VERY interval part to some cases, essentially forcing facilities into buying the newer models that cost millions of dollars, just so they can keep doing the procedures that had been doing previously.   Ive never seen that sort of product discontinuation around any other clip or staple load, or stapler in this job, because if Ethicon says they're not going to make a lap staple anymore, or discontinue support, a facility can turn around and do business with 5 other competitors.

Lost 18k. Pulled my money out and stopped trading for like a month or two. I was still up but I was also pretty devastated. Realized it\u2019s not easy money and I needed to be smarter. I eventually bought back into just stocks and started buying leaps. Sitting at 75k right now. I don\u2019t have the crazy gains that you see here but I also don\u2019t have the crazy losses either.

Had no idea what that even was but it allowed me to start making bigger bets and It was the company that got me into options, which obviously are the biggest part of my gains. I had known about DraftKings for years and thought it was an absolute beast of a company. Full ATM machine/ print money at will. Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early. Picked some catalyst dates and picked a spread of options with varying risk)My latest and biggest gainer is Gme.

Took a break just adding to my account for the next year holding shit stonks until I got up to 8k and started options again but smaller positions.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone.

When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

A month ago, when I first invested in GME, the whole uber-squeeze scenario did not make sense to me. The big players like Melvin Capital and BofA do not just let themselves get fucked over easily like that, they've got loads of ways, connections and ammo to bid their time and exit at breakeven or even minor profit.  What is quite likely, is this TSLA scenario, where we slowly burn up and up for weeks and months next year, as long as a constant stream of new positive catalysts hits the news every few days and the overall sentiment keeps slowly, but surely shifting from \"HAR HAR Blockbuster bankruptcy\" to \"well I'll be damned, they're actually turning this around...\"  Then, we might hit those $60+ price targets, which, even now, for most people would be a 3x at least.",

If the squeeze keeps getting delayed, paper hands and your typical bitch tits will get manipulated and leave at small profit.

            "The shelf offering of $100 million is less than 5 million shares at current price. It was 6.25 million shares back when the price was $16.   Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.  So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.  I do share at least some of the \"sell before earnings\" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.  But, the losing money argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores.  Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).  If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.  Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.     It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.",

But, Steam doesn't have a particular monopoly on this market other than a tiny bit of brand loyalty, as most PC gamers, including myself, associate online PC game downloads with it. Origin to lesser extent, and Epic to a bit greater extent, have both proven Steam is vulnerable to losing this market share though.  With 7 billion in revenue and a lot of trimmed fat (1000 store closures) and an extra cash from console sales, it would be totally viable for GME to divert a couple million bucks into a side project that can compete with these platforms. It's really not even that technically demanding, you're just hosting a glorified online marketplace, I can find you 10 Indian programmers who can do a stellar job at that for $150,000 tops.",

You get the feeling that you're talking with an aficionado, or a sommelier when picking out wines. And then there's the fact that they are shifting to more of an online focus.   But really what does it for me is that they currently have assets on hand valued at over $2.8B when the current market cap is $1.4B.

            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).",

            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).",

            "$20 is the clear support here, downward momentum got rejected hard today at that price, multiple times, just like the upward momentum got rejected at 22 yesterday, also multiple times. Sideways movement seems most likely for the next week, unless Daddy Cohen graces us with another \"over 9000\" 13D meme.  Bearish sentiment is slowly waning, and their hit pieces like that Motley Tool article earlier today and that retarded Shilling Alpha short thesis yesterday are edging on self-parody at this point.  A lot of non-WSB investing community is already woke on GME bull thesis, sounding off in the comments of afforementioned articles. Twitter is frenzied about GME too, following Hedgeye's bullish $50 target. Word is out and spreading fast.  With all this in mind, my fully amateur, incompetent, retard prediction is more of the same - opening hour bullishness resulting in big initial price spike/gap up, followed by meek/slow mid-day movement and small dips and rallies by the end of the day for the overall sideways trading pattern. We've rallied hard and fast this week, stonk has to cooldown a bit.  Lowest point is probably $19 Highest is 23, 22 wall is strong and thick and there's another one at 24 behind it, a lot of buys happened during the September q2 earnings dip into the $6 range, a lot of those longs will be exiting at 4x for sure.

With the setup we have, a slow gradual decrease of short interest, which has already been happening lately, followed by a slow gradual increase in price seems like the most likely way this short squeeze is going to effectively play out. That would also make it much less violent, and the price probably can't go super-parabolic, but it will definitely help push it a bit higher than it would be without this massive short accumulation.",
            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

Started reinvesting in some stocks I liked when a friend put me onto WSB. Saw the crazy gains and went spy calls for ez money. Doubled my 29k to 58k. Then June happened and my spy calls got fucked. Lost 18k. Pulled my money out and stopped trading for like a month or two. I was still up but I was also pretty devastated. Realized it\u2019s not easy money and I needed to be smarter. I eventually bought back into just stocks and started buying leaps. Sitting at 75k right now. I don\u2019t have the crazy gains that you see here but I also don\u2019t have the crazy losses either.

I convince him to purchase some Tesla shares pre split, at the moment those shares have doubled. I also predicted that other EV stocks such as XPEV will also blow up due to Tesla. Also prompted him on PLTR when they listed back in September. After seeing all these stocks go up I urgently needed to get my own trading account.

            "I started trading the first few months after I turned 18. Signed up to RH and my first few trades were very speculative. Afterwards sometime in December of 2018 I invested my first $600 in the market and lost about $500. I was holding NVDA at the time and some other stocks but NVDA took most of my money since i sold at a loss fearing i was never going to make my money back. Sometime in 2019 I was unemployed and started trading shares again. This time making minimal profits. Some $30 or $15. Very minuscule profits but it paid for my weed and gas. Fast forward to 2020, I jumped back into trading after a few months of having my account collect dust because I learned about options trading. Saw a few videos on youtube and said fuck it why not. Dont really know what all this gamma, vega, delta bullshit is but here goes nothing. And so far its been going better than i expected it to be.

I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays.

If I'm afraid of downside risk, I don't use borrowed money to buy.   I think this stock has a decent chance to reach 200 due to natural growth if Ryan gets control of the company. This may take many years to play out.  If squeeze happens and stock gets very high, I would sell a few percent to get my original investment back. The stock could reach much higher than people predicted when a real squeeze happens. So selling should be very slow.  Currently my largest position is still in TSLA, has been in that stock since 2012. Selling too fast can lead to regret.   Probably sell 1 share after a double, then slowly sell if it goes much higher than that.",

            "$20 is the clear support here, downward momentum got rejected hard today at that price, multiple times, just like the upward momentum got rejected at 22 yesterday, also multiple times. Sideways movement seems most likely for the next week, unless Daddy Cohen graces us with another \"over 9000\" 13D meme.  Bearish sentiment is slowly waning, and their hit pieces like that Motley Tool article earlier today and that retarded Shilling Alpha short thesis yesterday are edging on self-parody at this point.  A lot of non-WSB investing community is already woke on GME bull thesis, sounding off in the comments of afforementioned articles. Twitter is frenzied about GME too, following Hedgeye's bullish $50 target. Word is out and spreading fast.  With all this in mind, my fully amateur, incompetent, retard prediction is more of the same - opening hour bullishness resulting in big initial price spike/gap up, followed by meek/slow mid-day movement and small dips and rallies by the end of the day for the overall sideways trading pattern. We've rallied hard and fast this week, stonk has to cooldown a bit.  Lowest point is probably $19 Highest is 23, 22 wall is strong and thick and there's another one at 24 behind it, a lot of buys happened during the September q2 earnings dip into the $6 range, a lot of those longs will be exiting at 4x for sure.  Diamond hands baby, this is now an almost guaranteed 2x and a very likely 3-5x  Good luck to all.",
            "I said the same thing to u/ahminus earlier in one of the comment chains on a different threat, about the similarities to TSLA's short squeeze, which wasn't violent or fast, but took weeks, months to unravel.   With the setup we have, a slow gradual decrease of short interest, which has already been happening lately, followed by a slow gradual increase in price seems like the most likely way this short squeeze is going to effectively play out. That would also make it much less violent, and the price probably can't go super-parabolic, but it will definitely help push it a bit higher than it would be without this massive short accumulation.",
            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH.

I then started trying to make it back on earnings plays and things that should work (but never do), like shorting the entire country of Italy. I was making it back but slowly. So I deposited another $5k and caught some VIX DD from /u/dlkdev and bought some calls that worked out. That took me back up over $10K - all the way to $12.5k.  It's at this point I told my wife about all of this and bought her a new oven.  Then I went back in with $10K and got caught up in clang gang which was a loser. Down to about $5K now and all in on GME.  I have another account I use for more theta-gang strategies and I'm up about $7K for the year there, so overall up about $4K for the year so feeling pretty good.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes.

So Without knowing anything about options, I bought my first Spy Call expiring in a week. That was when Covid happened and stock crashed. After I bought spy puts, it went back up and I started being happy. Bought RCL puts. Was happy my money was recovering. And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it. And lost it all recently buying PLTR Calls and it crashed. Anyways. Thats my story. Just had to vent and get it off my chest, its been bothering me for a really long time for being this autistic.

Lost 18k. Pulled my money out and stopped trading for like a month or two. I was still up but I was also pretty devastated. Realized it\u2019s not easy money and I needed to be smarter. I eventually bought back into just stocks and started buying leaps. Sitting at 75k right now. I don\u2019t have the crazy gains that you see here but I also don\u2019t have the crazy losses either.

Have to be catalysts for the next 1-2 years since that is how long my trades go out. Then it\u2019s understanding the risks that would invalidate my thesis which is how i determine my risk tolerance. The winners are the ones that are the clear leader of their group, with the least amount of risk. So for semiconductor companies, the single leader (in my opinion) is Nvidia. Why? Because the fundamentals are super solid, they have a great history of consistently beating earnings, and when you look at the future and where we are going, Nvidias GPUs and DPUs are literally powering that future. Then you look at the risks and the biggest risk is this trade war and supply chain issues. When I compare the bull case to the bear case, the bull case is a much stronger argument. That is how you identify winners. Find the best sectors, best industries, and then the best companies within them. Look at the future and what society needs and the market needs and it will naturally guide you there. I only look at technicals until I have a fully formed investment idea, technicals are just there for entries and exits.   Good way to start is sit down with a blank sheet of paper and think about what our future looks like in 5-10 years then work backwards and figure out which companies will play the biggest most important role in that future.",

Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early.

When I turned 18 I opened a lynch account and started buying MSFT when ever I could. Worked for awhile and I had a 5k portfolio when I turned 20. Then I found WSB. I\u2019m down 55% on my Robinhood account (where I buy options) but my TD Account is up 80% YTD. I honestly just enjoy trading cause I feel closer to my grandpa.

Then a few weeks went by and I was scrolling through reddit  and seent an office meme about which characters of the show represent  which sub. (We're ryan's) spent a month learning options on yt. Within the first week I sold pge  at a loss right before it shot up and looked what I could of had. Never looked back. Lost 5k my first year on a yolo during the trade war that went South via trump tweet. Took a break just adding to my account for the next year holding shit stonks until I got up to 8k and started options again but smaller positions. Then in September I once again yoloed pge since it was moving again then it crashed 10% within hours of purchase. I got fired from my job on October 23 and my account was down to $630 on the 29th. I don't know if it was because I could stare at my phone all day or just dumb luck but I brought my account back from the dead and topped my account to $101,000 year to date when I sold fcel at damn near the top yesterday.

Got caught up on the wrong side in 08-09 melt down and lost another $100k+ real quick. Had my first kid and decided to go the safe route with index funds since I\u2019m a retard. Fool me once. Also hooked up with a guy to manage some of my money at Morgan about 4-5 years ago and also opened a Betterment account 4-5 years back and saw that crater this past March.

            "Camping out in the bathroom at the family xmas party, so I figured what the hell.  My grandparents first opened a Edward Jones account for me at the age of 13 and bought me 10 shares of boomer $T. It wasn\u2019t until 16 or 17 that I actually cared enough to do anything with stocks. Somewhere there in high school I realized that real money could be made in the stock market. I had them put an additional 500$ of my money in and sold some $T to buy $GOOG. At this time goog was 750ish a share. I spent the next 4-5 years of my life buying boomer stocks and watching everything go up in the bull market.   I got introduced to Reddit in late 2018. Somewhere in 2019 I decided I wanted to get more active with my portfolio management and switch to a non-boomer platform, hence the creation of my robinhood account. I bought some more boomer stocks and I few other I did research on. In late 2019 I started discovering the financial side of Reddit. That is about the time I found this place that I now call home. I started using option about then, I had lost a good chunk on money(still a college student so like only a couple Gs) then March 2020 hit. Spy Puts were the best thing since sliced bread. Literally couldn\u2019t go tits up. Made some pretty good money, decided this option thing was really easy. I proceeded to lose most of that money in pump and dump stocks until about October. In October I called it quits. I decided I should probably learn my stuff. Since October I have had steady gains and now sit at +20% on the year after being down 75 at its worst.   It\u2019s been a wild ride. I graduate college in April with an 85k job lined up. I can\u2019t wait to get my big boy pants on an add another 0 or two to my account balance.  Peace out \u2018tards",

Ford never really panned out, but Chevron did and I/we sold around $30 profit/share. When I turned 18 is when I hopped on robinhood, made some gains here and there buying low and selling high on some small company stocks.   I was in Engineering in college but then decided it wasn\u2019t my thing, switched to a Supply Chain major which involved taking a shitload of Accounting, Finance, Management, and etc type classes where I learned a bit about Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Risk Management. Made a rookie move back in March and sold as soon as I heard COVID was coming, didn\u2019t buy back in either (I was holding Tesla and Apple, for some reason turned bearish). Learned my lesson from that. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research/analysis and picking options without putting any actual money in them because losing a few hundred is devastating to a college student and I\u2019m not as ballsy as some of you fuckers.

Knew about WSB from a few YouTube videos where they talked badly about you autists, but wasn't being active in the sub, or even lurking back then.   My europoor broker app (Revolut) only allows buying and selling of shares. I figured good, because at least I won't gamble my money away on retarded YOLO plays like those WSB autists.  Bought my first stock (HAS) on August 14 2020.  Tried boomervesting, owning 69.4209001 diversified ass shares. After 1.5 months, made $5 profit on a $1000 investment. Fuck that shit. Sold everything off.  Knew about GME stock at that time, cuz I saw Michael Bury owning bigly shares. Become obsessed.    ***\"Why does Big Short guy own this dying company?\"***    Did a detailed DD on my own, back in September, before I even knew this sub was slowly getting obsessed with the same stock I was getting obsessed with.  Became a GME believer right then and there, months before joining WSB. Didn't have the balls to go all in. Fucking idiot. Fucking moron.  Tried the REGN Trump pump. Lost money.   Fuck it - started paperhanding GME on November 17.   Became active in WSB late November/early December. I feel like a retard at home here.  Received hate on WSB for paperhanding GME. Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.  Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.   Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.   Price go up to $14.85. I wait for dip.  Price go up to $15.85. ***I wait for dip***.  Dip to $15.4. ***I FOMO hard YOLO in all my spare cash.***  Own 231 GME shares.

So back in march I was playing the swings on inovio. I was a stupid trader and would go all in for 2k and buy shares. I was making around $300 dollars a week with 0 risk management and had no idea how dangerously I was actually playing. When inovio ran to $30 I had 1k in shares and two separate short term calls. I was up 8k and ultimately sold for a profit of 6.3k. I then pulled out 2k to put in savings and it went downhill from there. I started taking bigger trades and messing with options. I took a 2.6k loss on inovio and lost another 2k overtime with random stupid trades. I was down to my last 1k and took a break for a long time.

Eventually got out and quit for quiet a while.   But, anyone who has quit before knows you always come back. When I did come back maybe a year later, Robinhood offered options now. So I proceeded to dabble with that even though I had no idea what a call or put was and had no business trading options.

I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone.

            "I discovered wallstreetbets back during the ironyman saga. I didn't know what was happening and wsb sure as hell wasn't going to tell me, so I did some reading and learned about options. Put $500 in a RH account and promptly lost all but $150 on shitty otm calls. I was intrigued at that point, though, so I did some more reading, discovered spreads, and traded $150 up to $2k. Then the corona crash and subsequent recovery happened and I wiped my account as I failed to acknowledge the trend in both cases. At that point I decided directional trading was not for me--it was stressful as fuck and discussing me from my job, but at the same time I just couldn't leave it all bring now knowing about what you could do with options. Did some more reading, learned about theta strategies. Since then I've been running a directionally neutral theta strategy (not on RH obviously) that I have revised 3-4 times, and I'm finally making consistent gains and sleeping well at the same time. But it took a ton of research. I still spend time trying to learn more and analyzing past performance in order to slowly get better. And every step where I learn something new and improved my trading is incredibly gratifying. It's been a ton of fun from the start",
            "Started 2 months ago, up 40k. It feels so unreal but real at the same time. Like on my phone it\u2019s just numbers, but when I think about how much money that actually is I get so happy that I found this sub.",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",
            "This year around a few days before the crash. I don\u2019t know if I just saw something on the news regarding said crash or what but I had this urge to want to start a portfolio.  Took about a month before I was actually approved to begin trading and put in $300 in a few Delta and AMD shares. Sold those for a minor profit.  And during that time a lot of posts from here would pop up occasionally in popular for me as I browsed so I\u2019d lurk around confused about what it was about. The memes really drew me in though.  Learned about options and lost all of my gains. Until recently when I saw the DD post of PLTR while it was at $15. I said fuck it and deposit what I had in my savings to buy shares and leaps.  Aaaand. Now we\u2019re here. Got $2k profit so far so that\u2019s kinda cool.

            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with.

I wasn\u2019t gonna walk away from a woman who\u2019s a friend and also a client of mine just to help clean. I valued her thoughts of me personally and on a business standpoint as more valuable. Anyway my boss then chose to lay me off for two weeks even though she promised she wouldn\u2019t. I was already value investing with no luck and every position I had was down. I said fuck it I got no job and no income for 2 weeks I gotta try something different. I put the last check I had in my Robinhood it was about 300 dollars. I bought a call 2 weeks out on spy and I made 50 bucks after 2 days. Felt great I continued to buy calls EOD and usually puts midday. Doing this I perpetually made 100-200 a week without working. I did this for about 3 months. My account kept growing and I just repeated this process averaging down along the way. Eventually I got a much larger account and started studying more and yeah. Now I swing trade options Months to years out. All started from my boss giving me the shaft and we later ended up with a great relationship. I was now making so much money through options I didn\u2019t have to beg for work anymore. I could say no, that brought her down a lot and made her treat me fairer. Now things are ok.",
            "Started on March 15th this year with $5k. Bought puts during the dip and was up $500 or so and then things started turning around. I got caught up in diamond hands and rode it down to $2200.   I then started trying to make it back on earnings plays and things that should work (but never do), like shorting the entire country of Italy. I was making it back but slowly. So I deposited another $5k and caught some VIX DD from /u/dlkdev and bought some calls that worked out. That took me back up over $10K - all the way to $12.5k.  It's at this point I told my wife about all of this and bought her a new oven.  Then I went back in with $10K and got caught up in clang gang which was a loser. Down to about $5K now and all in on GME.  I have another account I use for more theta-gang strategies and I'm up about $7K for the year there, so overall up about $4K for the year so feeling pretty good.  I made ~500 trades across three or four brokerages (RH, TW, Fidelity, Vanguard) so I'm going to hate tax time.  Also, Vanguard is surprisingly nice for trading options. Who'd have thought?",
            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

I bought spy calls and nio options and other weekly fds which did well before March to April where stonks went flat and I lost 3k after buying like dumb ass nio calls with no volume so there was literally no buyer for a week and a half as I watched it bleed to 0. I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays.

Todd said the market was the most overvalued he'd ever seen, that he was short up to his boxers,  so I sold everything the day before I left town for a creative writers conference. The next day the NASDAQ drilled 600 points.

When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.

            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

I know it\u2019s mostly all out of financial ignorance so I don\u2019t ever say anything but even still, the amount of hate people have for wealthy people is astounding.   I\u2019m not rich. I could definitely use 2k vs 600 in stimulus. But never in my fucking life would I try to advocate murdering bezos or whoever the meme hates this week. Like, it embarrasses me to watch another human so shamelessly display such intense jealousy for what another human has built.  To me, that sort of thinking just exemplifies the type of life a person like this lives\u2014bitching in the dark with their hand out, trying to take from someone else instead of using their success as an example for building their own. It\u2019s just super pathetic and cringy IMO. Like in high school when the ugly bitches don\u2019t like the hot girl for no other reason than she is hot and the boys like her.   That\u2019s why WSB is great. We all know that we could be rich, but it\u2019s our own fault that we aren\u2019t.

            "I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the female members of this group. The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

My father was a plumber by trade, flatulist by hoppy...made sense considering the smells he had to whiff in his line of work. Taught me how to control my gas from an early age, and I supplement this control with a ghstly diet. Find it's a good way of putting people in their place.....   Anyway I'm at Big Five near Los Angeles, CA... The pandemic is getting really bad here and the gov is about to bang up everybody in their homes....while I'm minding my own business trying to buy a gun and not spread the plague a man walks in....no mask on.   The scrawny kid up front tells John Wayne he'll need to wear a mask. \"Really?\" asks the duke incredulously as he sashays over to the fishing section.   Scrawny clearly doesn't know how to handle him but I do. I was locked and loaded, with a gut full of bananas dipped in salsa, milk, and Bush's pinto beans...my stomach was a scud missile and the duke was lookin like a saudi base.   I strolled over to John as he drooled over a fishing rod. We were back to back but I could see his reflection in my glasses. I waited patiently for my quarry to turn around. As soon I saw his floppy mug I let loose.   For about two seconds a sound somewhere between a shotgun blast and a hog revving roared through the store.   I spun around in case Marion tried to sucker punch me...to me relief I didn't feel any stool in my man panties. He looked shocked and angry, like a haughty cat sprayed with water.   We locked eyes like a couple of rams about to duel, and then the gas wafted up to his face. His lips warped into a terrible rictus and he turned tail...I think he said \"Jesus Christ\" as he scampered off.   He hopped in his plush F-150 and sped away never to return to Big Five... Didn't want to wear a mask to stop a virus...couldn't handle a little ass blast. Real tough guy.",

That Astrazeneca vaccine was trialed in the UK.  Why do you think their vaccine only tested 60-70% effective and then had  to go back for more testing? Cause half of the patients probably had  the one strain (where it's 95% effective) and the other half had other strains where it's only \\~45% effective. That's why they had wacky  results where a small subset got a 'half dose' and was 90% effective. Cause the small subset just happened to have the one strain that was the more effective strain for the vaccine.

They also have positive earnings catalysts for q1...vaccine, pent up demand for elective surgery and a lower dollar for jnj....lower dollar, stimulus,and reopening story for coke....rgnx is a good small cap growth stock to have to complement my dividend plays.. it is also in a lot of popular etfs and i just believe biotech is going to be really strong going into next year. Its another area that people bought the dip on and are sitting on huge profits but cant sell for tax purposes ....biotech also benefits from falling rates.

Apart from monogenic diseases, most diseases are caused by many different genetic mutations and environment so a tool such as crispr while revolutionary for basic science is simply not adequate.

I was surprised to learn crsr fixed sickle cell on human patient. This is very promising but a lot of genetics/biotech seems to come up with miracle cures on lab only to fail phase III.

            "My background is in nanotechnology and mechanical engineering, with a brief stint in finance after school. I spent a little time on biomed (my thesis was actually about gene therapy nano particle vectoring for cystic fibrosis patients) but I love machines too so now work in manufacturing.  There are still 5,000-8,000 monogenic diseases out there. Of course we are not ready to begin human clinical trials on a wide scale but animal lab studies are in progress. Recently a Chinese researcher used CRISPR to edit the CCR5 gene out of human fetuses. Those children are now alive and immune to HIV (although it was an egregious ethical transgression in the eyes of most science professionals to do that without knowing the potential consequences or consulting the industry about human genetic editing ethical standards). Later got sued for it or something. Google the name He Jiankui. The point is public awareness and motivation for scientific experimentation around the technology are making big strides recently.   Individual genetic mutations do occur that can confound targeting and yes cas9 can make errors in site selection. Book-ending the active protein with cas9 instead of just one helps, as does appending RNA \u201chairpins\u201d to help with specific targeting. Those hairpins have been shown to 50x targeting accuracy (Thats off the top of my head, so don\u2019t quote me but I remember the figure I read was at least an order of magnitude increase). Also keep in mind in the future we will likely be able to sequence a patient\u2019s genome down to the base pairs and account for those unexpected discrepancies. There will be plenty of developmental and regulatory barriers along the way but that\u2019s the case for any new medical technology. Old school pharma fails in phase III 95% of the time too. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t rake it on on the products that actually go to market. I think this sector would behave similarly, but the ones that land will go way bigger way faster. Many small biotech shops you know of are struggling to do the same thing Pfizer does with similar technology and way less resources. This is something entirely different  The main question for me is how long that will remain too cost prohibitive for widespread adoption.",

I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.   I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I\u2019ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year.   Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it\u2019s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options).   Thank you, and have a Merry Christmas.  I digress.",

You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

Used games, are good until the next console cycle, there is no difference in the new and used game. However what you are describing is a different market, buying outdated tech in the hopes you can resell all of it. You are talking about holding a lot of stock and more importantly the person buying it needs to know what fair value is for each device. This also leave open holes as items go up for sale on huge discounts and people can possibly resell on to Gamestop for profit. Flood Gamestop with a drone that they didn't realize was going obsolete.  Moreover phones are not really part of this opportunity, so you are talking more niche products like drones. Why not phones? Because most phones are on plans and those plans involve turning the phone back over in order to receive the discount on the next upgrade. Even if they were, ask yourself if after the GeekSquad searching laptops fiasco at BestBuy if you really want to turn your phones over to Gamestop employees.  The local delivery angle is a way they can shine, but in your calculations you don't seem to be paying him. In a couple of years it will be 15$ an hour in most major cities cutting hard into the 50$ profit of the delivery itself, you need to make sure you are reselling a drone or gadget every 3 hours.

            "I am a PLTR long-long but your thesis is weak.  Tendietards don't have the same capital management considerations that Buffett does; one of his major ones being direct return of cash to shareholders. He's a dividend investor, when he isn't buying businesses whole that generate surplus cash.   When Buffett/BRK started getting into KO, it was 1) one of the best brands on earth 2) growing worldwide 3) throwing off a div 4) Somewhat beaten down in price relative to the gleam of its actual business perspective after the Cola Wars and the \"New Coke\" disaster of the 1980s; an AMAZING choice to park large wads of cash for both direct return and potential growth upside. His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE? HOLDING STONKS FOR A LONG TIME CAN MAKE MONEY!\"",

            "The shelf offering of $100 million is less than 5 million shares at current price. It was 6.25 million shares back when the price was $16.   Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.  So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.  I do share at least some of the \"sell before earnings\" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.  But, the losing money argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores.  Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).  If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.  Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.     It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.",

That doesn't factor in any additional growth that GME is able to create, which could raise sales figures into the billions. even if the company only manages to capture \\~10% of the gaming market (about $175 billion worldwide today), all in ecommerce sales, if we base the value of the company on even a 1x multiplier then the company would be worth $17.5 billion or $265 a share.

If **all** property taxes became **enforceably** illegal.   And, you had the IRS and Treasury sending the Secret Service.   After every municipal politburo. Who got cute on Uncle Sam.   Trying to pass property taxes through any means. To double-dip+.   Then maybe that could be viable.   As, i've never seen a way to enforce the GST.   Even if we passed a Constitutional Ammendment.   To block the States capabilities to just write their own,  - \"F you rest of the USA Ammendments\"  - Ie \"We enjoy no tariffs, or other remittances.\"  - Ie \"We wave away federal protections. By State constitutional amendment.\"   - Then, we'll, \"Bad State\". Tax residents a property tax.   At least *one* State will get it through.   Matter of marketing, ignorance (time), and greed.   20-25 yrs of passable observance. Then, wel have a double or triple tax.   Regressively based, and practical every locality will be jumping for it.   \"Free money\" that would sure be nice to monopolise. When everyone else does it too.  No *way to fail* and that's a **failure**.  That's why GST is untenable.   It doesn't fit within our foundational structure.  Its inversely engineered.   - Blocks our controls on abuse. Otherwise inbuilt.   - Ie malfeasance.   Instead of,   - Controls on malfeasance.   - By increasing capital flow.   - Ie direct disbursements, paid out \"guaranteed\".   - A step removed. From SINGLE wrongdoing localities.  Stoping a trending towards fiefdom. Eliminating total monopolies.  Ie property taxes,  - Raised to fix their own failures.   Instead of fixing what they can by *themselves*.   Then,   - Reaching out for the rest of the nation to build them up further.   - Ie grants, etc.   If something is truly out of reach. Their need remains, so OUR issue remains.   It will **be met** so long as the nation can meet it.   The GST would take away that leg up. From as needed grants, federally.   Losing tariffs, and a de-conglomerated financial pipeline. From top-down.   We could increase cashflow accross board.   Ie,  - Post-residents gaining a small regular cashflow.   This *guaranteed flow*.   Keeps large debt payments. From draining stagnant incomes.   ``` Residents money -&gt; elsewhere  Per resident,  resourcesNewToTax &lt; resourcesOldToTax  propertyTaxes++ while taxableResources-- ```   This,  In a locality that sees no realistic appreciation.   - Ie most of our nation's small towns.   Then,   Death spirals occur. In population, investiture, and appreciation.  A cashflow through a guaranteed income. Even small, buys us time.  Allowing *on* 'spiral' **start**.   Congress time++ to react. With our existing procedures for assistance.  Keeping the \"death\" out of the equation.",

There\u2019s probably another \u2018wave\u2019 coming, so you idiots who bought it after a 20% run up can hold tight and hope it runs again when the merge takes place, maybe near the $25-30 mark depending on how the market responds and Barkbox fundamentals.

At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.   Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition.

Showtime will compete against HBO which has a lack of leadership.

North America is basically doomed at this point, your leaders have sold you all out and I give it 50 years tops in the best case scenario, before it becomes nothing but a Chinese proxy.  No politician or any 'system figurehead', as I like to call them (think Bill Gates and co.) is selfless, they're self-serving, most of them pricks, a few of them with a smidge of moral compass, but as a whole, they're there to ensure the \"plebs\" are in line, one way or another.  I'm speaking this from a perspective of a dude that was born during a communist regime fallout. I was a baby, so I'd lie if I said I remember anything from firsthand experience other than some fuzzy memories about running from the warzones, but I'm a direct descendant of 2 families that got killed, tortured and oppressed by the marxist ideology, systemically, for decades.  And if you think I'm some right wing nutcase, guess again. I hate fascism at least as equally, because that shit DIRECTLY CAUSED those 50 years of murderous communism in my homeland, on top of a mass genocide of Jews and other 'undesirables', sale of my region to Italy and overall psychotic ideology that was the catalyst for WW2.  I'm a member of a minuscule minority of population who has a drop of sane thought left in their brains in my country. A lot of my peers are radicalized, by left and right wing toxic ideologies. It's psychotic at times. I can't have 2 of my best friends in the same room because they fucking hate each other, because of some fuckwad ideologies from 1945.

Intuitive surgical will have to change the way they design their equipment, and offer way more support to legacy systems to thrive once the music stops.  for example, Intuitive no longer offers GI staple loads for their older surgical robots, a very VERY interval part to some cases, essentially forcing facilities into buying the newer models that cost millions of dollars, just so they can keep doing the procedures that had been doing previously.   Ive never seen that sort of product discontinuation around any other clip or staple load, or stapler in this job, because if Ethicon says they're not going to make a lap staple anymore, or discontinue support, a facility can turn around and do business with 5 other competitors.

Origin to lesser extent, and Epic to a bit greater extent, have both proven Steam is vulnerable to losing this market share though.  With 7 billion in revenue and a lot of trimmed fat (1000 store closures) and an extra cash from console sales, it would be totally viable for GME to divert a couple million bucks into a side project that can compete with these platforms.

And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it.

This year I\u2019ve done really well and it\u2019s because I have set goals, abide by them, and if something goes sideways, I don\u2019t stress because no one trade makes up too much of my account.  Three years ago because I had less, I would dedicate too much to just a few trades and if the market turned I was stuck. I didn\u2019t want to sell at huge losses but I also then didn\u2019t have any money to trade with. That led to a lot of stress and emotional (and therefore bad) decisions.  Now if something goes against me, I can just let it sit until it recovers and go about my business.

The winners are the ones that are the clear leader of their group, with the least amount of risk. So for semiconductor companies, the single leader (in my opinion) is Nvidia. Why? Because the fundamentals are super solid, they have a great history of consistently beating earnings, and when you look at the future and where we are going, Nvidias GPUs and DPUs are literally powering that future. Then you look at the risks and the biggest risk is this trade war and supply chain issues. When I compare the bull case to the bear case, the bull case is a much stronger argument. That is how you identify winners. Find the best sectors, best industries, and then the best companies within them. Look at the future and what society needs and the market needs and it will naturally guide you there. I only look at technicals until I have a fully formed investment idea, technicals are just there for entries and exits.

My grandparents first opened a Edward Jones account for me at the age of 13 and bought me 10 shares of boomer $T. It wasn\u2019t until 16 or 17 that I actually cared enough to do anything with stocks. Somewhere there in high school I realized that real money could be made in the stock market. I had them put an additional 500$ of my money in and sold some $T to buy $GOOG. At this time goog was 750ish a share. I spent the next 4-5 years of my life buying boomer stocks and watching everything go up in the bull market.   I got introduced to Reddit in late 2018. Somewhere in 2019 I decided I wanted to get more active with my portfolio management and switch to a non-boomer platform, hence the creation of my robinhood account. I bought some more boomer stocks and I few other I did research on. In late 2019 I started discovering the financial side of Reddit. That is about the time I found this place that I now call home. I started using option about then, I had lost a good chunk on money(still a college student so like only a couple Gs) then March 2020 hit. Spy Puts were the best thing since sliced bread. Literally couldn\u2019t go tits up. Made some pretty good money, decided this option thing was really easy. I proceeded to lose most of that money in pump and dump stocks until about October. In October I called it quits. I decided I should probably learn my stuff. Since October I have had steady gains and now sit at +20% on the year after being down 75 at its worst.   It\u2019s been a wild ride. I graduate college in April with an 85k job lined up. I can\u2019t wait to get my big boy pants on an add another 0 or two to my account balance.  Peace out \u2018tards",

So back in march I was playing the swings on inovio. I was a stupid trader and would go all in for 2k and buy shares. I was making around $300 dollars a week with 0 risk management and had no idea how dangerously I was actually playing. When inovio ran to $30 I had 1k in shares and two separate short term calls. I was up 8k and ultimately sold for a profit of 6.3k. I then pulled out 2k to put in savings and it went downhill from there. I started taking bigger trades and messing with options. I took a 2.6k loss on inovio and lost another 2k overtime with random stupid trades. I was down to my last 1k and took a break for a long time. I started reading stock books, taking some classes, learning technical analysis and risk management strategies. I currently have 2k I\u2019m playing with and want to daytrade options until I have 10k when I will invest 50% index funds and 50% blue chip stocks. I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at :)",

            "Found this sub 4 years ago and started dabbling in stocks on Robinhood. I put about 2000 in my account and was making some decent gains until everyone on here was talking about how RAD was about to enter a merger and it was gonna moon. I remember I had missed out on a lot of big plays this sub was making back then and I pretty much went all in on this one. Rad then dropped from $8 to $4 and $4 to $2 while I kept averaging down. Eventually got out and quit for quiet a while.   But, anyone who has quit before knows you always come back. When I did come back maybe a year later, Robinhood offered options now. So I proceeded to dabble with that even though I had no idea what a call or put was and had no business trading options. Ended up losing another couple hundred and quit for another year and now I\u2019m back again, but this time I\u2019m taking a much safer approach by investing heavily into good stocks like GME.

Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k. Started a TDA with 1k, still fucked up, but did better, at 5k and with a solid understanding that I\u2019m still a retard.   So, how long before I\u2019m profitable? Who knows. Can\u2019t do math. Down 13k (95%) on old account up 2k on new account. Won\u2019t take long considering new account I\u2019m heavy in the four horsemen, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME. Shares and leaps. Cheers you guys.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

            "I discovered wallstreetbets back during the ironyman saga. I didn't know what was happening and wsb sure as hell wasn't going to tell me, so I did some reading and learned about options. Put $500 in a RH account and promptly lost all but $150 on shitty otm calls. I was intrigued at that point, though, so I did some more reading, discovered spreads, and traded $150 up to $2k. Then the corona crash and subsequent recovery happened and I wiped my account as I failed to acknowledge the trend in both cases. At that point I decided directional trading was not for me--it was stressful as fuck and discussing me from my job, but at the same time I just couldn't leave it all bring now knowing about what you could do with options. Did some more reading, learned about theta strategies. Since then I've been running a directionally neutral theta strategy (not on RH obviously) that I have revised 3-4 times, and I'm finally making consistent gains and sleeping well at the same time. But it took a ton of research. I still spend time trying to learn more and analyzing past performance in order to slowly get better. And every step where I learn something new and improved my trading is incredibly gratifying. It's been a ton of fun from the start",

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

I pussied out of every good play I had and did nothing until early august. Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.   Well, it\u2019s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD\u2019s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week.

            "I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).",

I then started trying to make it back on earnings plays and things that should work (but never do), like shorting the entire country of Italy. I was making it back but slowly. So I deposited another $5k and caught some VIX DD from /u/dlkdev and bought some calls that worked out. That took me back up over $10K - all the way to $12.5k.  It's at this point I told my wife about all of this and bought her a new oven.  Then I went back in with $10K and got caught up in clang gang which was a loser. Down to about $5K now and all in on GME.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

I bought spy calls and nio options and other weekly fds which did well before March to April where stonks went flat and I lost 3k after buying like dumb ass nio calls with no volume so there was literally no buyer for a week and a half as I watched it bleed to 0. I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays. I joined theta gang and started the wheel. Now I am proud of my portfolio and occasionally yolo on stuff like gme, steel, or other spacs which is the new cool thing into tendies.",

            "36 y/o teacher looking to get rich since I\u2019ve plateaued income-wise. I started in early 2018 when I saw you motherfuckers talking about yachts. When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "Interesting about Roku. I never use it. Only Netflix. Do you think it\u2019s the future?  Good to know you have 80 stocks. I have 200k invested with only 25 stocks so far. I thought I was already over diversified. Lol  I\u2019m eying the meme stock PLTR. Buying about 1,000 shares. Good idea?",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

Taught me how to control my gas from an early age, and I supplement this control with a ghstly diet. Find it's a good way of putting people in their place.....   Anyway I'm at Big Five near Los Angeles, CA... The pandemic is getting really bad here and the gov is about to bang up everybody in their homes....while I'm minding my own business trying to buy a gun and not spread the plague a man walks in....no mask on.   The scrawny kid up front tells John Wayne he'll need to wear a mask. \"Really?\" asks the duke incredulously as he sashays over to the fishing section.   Scrawny clearly doesn't know how to handle him but I do. I was locked and loaded, with a gut full of bananas dipped in salsa, milk, and Bush's pinto beans...my stomach was a scud missile and the duke was lookin like a saudi base.   I strolled over to John as he drooled over a fishing rod. We were back to back but I could see his reflection in my glasses. I waited patiently for my quarry to turn around. As soon I saw his floppy mug I let loose.   For about two seconds a sound somewhere between a shotgun blast and a hog revving roared through the store.   I spun around in case Marion tried to sucker punch me...to me relief I didn't feel any stool in my man panties. He looked shocked and angry, like a haughty cat sprayed with water.   We locked eyes like a couple of rams about to duel, and then the gas wafted up to his face. His lips warped into a terrible rictus and he turned tail...I think he said \"Jesus Christ\" as he scampered off.   He hopped in his plush F-150 and sped away never to return to Big Five... Didn't want to wear a mask to stop a virus...couldn't handle a little ass blast. Real tough guy.",

That Astrazeneca vaccine was trialed in the UK.  Why do you think their vaccine only tested 60-70% effective and then had  to go back for more testing? Cause half of the patients probably had  the one strain (where it's 95% effective) and the other half had other strains where it's only \\~45% effective. That's why they had wacky  results where a small subset got a 'half dose' and was 90% effective.

We just don\u2019t understand genetic underpinnings of most complex diseases. Apart from monogenic diseases, most diseases are caused by many different genetic mutations and environment so a tool such as crispr while revolutionary for basic science is simply not adequate. Also it seems like crispr has its limitations. I read that cas9 is error prone and cutting DNA seems to cause an aging like effect on the cell. I was surprised to learn crsr fixed sickle cell on human patient. This is very promising but a lot of genetics/biotech seems to come up with miracle cures on lab only to fail phase III.

            "My background is in nanotechnology and mechanical engineering, with a brief stint in finance after school. I spent a little time on biomed (my thesis was actually about gene therapy nano particle vectoring for cystic fibrosis patients) but I love machines too so now work in manufacturing.  There are still 5,000-8,000 monogenic diseases out there. Of course we are not ready to begin human clinical trials on a wide scale but animal lab studies are in progress. Recently a Chinese researcher used CRISPR to edit the CCR5 gene out of human fetuses. Those children are now alive and immune to HIV (although it was an egregious ethical transgression in the eyes of most science professionals to do that without knowing the potential consequences or consulting the industry about human genetic editing ethical standards). Later got sued for it or something. Google the name He Jiankui. The point is public awareness and motivation for scientific experimentation around the technology are making big strides recently.   Individual genetic mutations do occur that can confound targeting and yes cas9 can make errors in site selection. Book-ending the active protein with cas9 instead of just one helps, as does appending RNA \u201chairpins\u201d to help with specific targeting. Those hairpins have been shown to 50x targeting accuracy (Thats off the top of my head, so don\u2019t quote me but I remember the figure I read was at least an order of magnitude increase). Also keep in mind in the future we will likely be able to sequence a patient\u2019s genome down to the base pairs and account for those unexpected discrepancies. There will be plenty of developmental and regulatory barriers along the way but that\u2019s the case for any new medical technology. Old school pharma fails in phase III 95% of the time too. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t rake it on on the products that actually go to market. I think this sector would behave similarly, but the ones that land will go way bigger way faster. Many small biotech shops you know of are struggling to do the same thing Pfizer does with similar technology and way less resources. This is something entirely different  The main question for me is how long that will remain too cost prohibitive for widespread adoption.",

This may take many years to play out.  If squeeze happens and stock gets very high, I would sell a few percent to get my original investment back. The stock could reach much higher than people predicted when a real squeeze happens. So selling should be very slow.

            "So here\u2019s what I think about timing the Market and the conventional wisdom surrounding it-  Let\u2019s look at last March, for instance, markets dropped about 35% from feb 20 to mar 20.  My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.   I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I\u2019ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year.   Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it\u2019s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options).   Thank you, and have a Merry Christmas.  I digress.",

With the setup we have, a slow gradual decrease of short interest, which has already been happening lately, followed by a slow gradual increase in price seems like the most likely way this short squeeze is going to effectively play out.

If the other stuff is going to come to pass it will be clear enough by the time this current console cycle is losing its initial steam.  In short you can buy and hold for at least a year.

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

            "This is not a good plan. Gamestop would have to be able to reliably turn around aging hardware tech which is not the same thing as used games. Used games, are good until the next console cycle, there is no difference in the new and used game. However what you are describing is a different market, buying outdated tech in the hopes you can resell all of it. You are talking about holding a lot of stock and more importantly the person buying it needs to know what fair value is for each device. This also leave open holes as items go up for sale on huge discounts and people can possibly resell on to Gamestop for profit. Flood Gamestop with a drone that they didn't realize was going obsolete.  Moreover phones are not really part of this opportunity, so you are talking more niche products like drones. Why not phones? Because most phones are on plans and those plans involve turning the phone back over in order to receive the discount on the next upgrade. Even if they were, ask yourself if after the GeekSquad searching laptops fiasco at BestBuy if you really want to turn your phones over to Gamestop employees.  The local delivery angle is a way they can shine, but in your calculations you don't seem to be paying him. In a couple of years it will be 15$ an hour in most major cities cutting hard into the 50$ profit of the delivery itself, you need to make sure you are reselling a drone or gadget every 3 hours.

I would argue we are nearing that now. They rely on technology (other companies are catching up and replicating that strategy) and extremely aggressive sales tactics. In reality, a lot of their purchase business is lower end FICO first time home buyers because they\u2019re one of the few companies that go down to 580 FICO and can close it quickly.  The purchase market is booming right now but QLs isn\u2019t and People who have had more than one mortgage in their lifetime usually shop around and higher end FICO conventional loans and those considered more safe for servicing are getting taken care of through the wholesale channel (RKT is expanding in that but lower margins than retail) or banks.

            "I am a PLTR long-long but your thesis is weak.  Tendietards don't have the same capital management considerations that Buffett does; one of his major ones being direct return of cash to shareholders. He's a dividend investor, when he isn't buying businesses whole that generate surplus cash.   When Buffett/BRK started getting into KO, it was 1) one of the best brands on earth 2) growing worldwide 3) throwing off a div 4) Somewhat beaten down in price relative to the gleam of its actual business perspective after the Cola Wars and the \"New Coke\" disaster of the 1980s; an AMAZING choice to park large wads of cash for both direct return and potential growth upside. His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE? HOLDING STONKS FOR A LONG TIME CAN MAKE MONEY!\"",

            "The shelf offering of $100 million is less than 5 million shares at current price. It was 6.25 million shares back when the price was $16.   Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.  So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.  I do share at least some of the \"sell before earnings\" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.  But, the losing money argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores.  Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).  If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.  Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.     It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.",

It's earning for you.  Example, I've been yoloing on the oil indexes.   If you dumped your 100k, internally within Robinhood. Into USOI.   You could've made $2691~ this month.  That's a lot of $4 yolo money, every month.   To buy the next \ud83d\udcb0 $PLTR \ud83d\udcb0  When a based Autist on here marks it for tendies. \ud83d\udc4d   Or be a \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b.

            "There's no way no property taxes would fly.  Every locality is practically forced to enforce them. With no actual way for the feds to stop it.  The gst will destroy everyone who lives on a fixed income.  Ie largest % of the nation.  Because yes a typically thought of \"middle class income\". At 50k non-gross.   Is \"fixed\" after one financially endebetures themselves.  Then refinances those credit cards + student loans. Into a fixed and managed debt repayment plan.  If **all** property taxes became **enforceably** illegal.   And, you had the IRS and Treasury sending the Secret Service.   After every municipal politburo. Who got cute on Uncle Sam.   Trying to pass property taxes through any means. To double-dip+.   Then maybe that could be viable.   As, i've never seen a way to enforce the GST.   Even if we passed a Constitutional Ammendment.   To block the States capabilities to just write their own,  - \"F you rest of the USA Ammendments\"  - Ie \"We enjoy no tariffs, or other remittances.\"  - Ie \"We wave away federal protections. By State constitutional amendment.\"   - Then, we'll, \"Bad State\". Tax residents a property tax.   At least *one* State will get it through.   Matter of marketing, ignorance (time), and greed.   20-25 yrs of passable observance. Then, wel have a double or triple tax.   Regressively based, and practical every locality will be jumping for it.   \"Free money\" that would sure be nice to monopolise. When everyone else does it too.  No *way to fail* and that's a **failure**.  That's why GST is untenable.   It doesn't fit within our foundational structure.  Its inversely engineered.   - Blocks our controls on abuse. Otherwise inbuilt.   - Ie malfeasance.   Instead of,   - Controls on malfeasance.   - By increasing capital flow.   - Ie direct disbursements, paid out \"guaranteed\".   - A step removed. From SINGLE wrongdoing localities.  Stoping a trending towards fiefdom. Eliminating total monopolies.  Ie property taxes,  - Raised to fix their own failures.   Instead of fixing what they can by *themselves*.   Then,   - Reaching out for the rest of the nation to build them up further.   - Ie grants, etc.   If something is truly out of reach. Their need remains, so OUR issue remains.   It will **be met** so long as the nation can meet it.   The GST would take away that leg up. From as needed grants, federally.   Losing tariffs, and a de-conglomerated financial pipeline. From top-down.   We could increase cashflow accross board.   Ie,  - Post-residents gaining a small regular cashflow.   This *guaranteed flow*.   Keeps large debt payments. From draining stagnant incomes.   ``` Residents money -&gt; elsewhere  Per resident,  resourcesNewToTax &lt; resourcesOldToTax  propertyTaxes++ while taxableResources-- ```   This,  In a locality that sees no realistic appreciation.   - Ie most of our nation's small towns.   Then,   Death spirals occur. In population, investiture, and appreciation.  A cashflow through a guaranteed income. Even small, buys us time.  Allowing *on* 'spiral' **start**.   Congress time++ to react. With our existing procedures for assistance.  Keeping the \"death\" out of the equation.",

IRS gets bitchy if you need to pay over 1000 in taxes at the end of the year from self employment and trading - they want their cut quarterly.

My trade is in part based on expectations being much lower than Disney and they over delivering in a big way. I think the upside could be greater than a 10-15% move post investor day. Also betting on a run up to investor day as we get more info but I like how they are doing new Star Trek and building on the franchises they own.

At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.   Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition. When the deal closes (likely in my view) the stock will trade up to the take out price and you\u2019ll get cash. Don\u2019t be stupid. Some deals are very very risky.

Even then though, at least Citron is public, OP is just hiding behind a username. Citron has a tiny bit more accountability to not just be huge pumpers, because there's an easy trail for the SEC if necessary.  But yeah, Citron literally buys or shorts the names they analyze, so their analysis has to be taken with a grain of salt. That's very different from equity research when firms like Goldman issue a price target on, say, Tesla, because then, that analyst doesn't touch Tesla stock, they're paid to research it, not to own it.",

North America is basically doomed at this point, your leaders have sold you all out and I give it 50 years tops in the best case scenario, before it becomes nothing but a Chinese proxy.

Ive never seen that sort of product discontinuation around any other clip or staple load, or stapler in this job, because if Ethicon says they're not going to make a lap staple anymore, or discontinue support, a facility can turn around and do business with 5 other competitors.

            "Wasn't it like th cars never drove, just the insides lit up? And the demo footage was shot with the trucks going down a hill and then they edited the camera angle, cuz the cars could never drive.   I thought Nikola was straight up fraud",
            "I'm still on Steam myself, Epic is only for Fortnite which I haven't played in over a year now.  But, Steam doesn't have a particular monopoly on this market other than a tiny bit of brand loyalty, as most PC gamers, including myself, associate online PC game downloads with it. Origin to lesser extent, and Epic to a bit greater extent, have both proven Steam is vulnerable to losing this market share though.  With 7 billion in revenue and a lot of trimmed fat (1000 store closures) and an extra cash from console sales, it would be totally viable for GME to divert a couple million bucks into a side project that can compete with these platforms. It's really not even that technically demanding, you're just hosting a glorified online marketplace, I can find you 10 Indian programmers who can do a stellar job at that for $150,000 tops.",
            "Yes. It's a total fraud. If someone didn't know that before the Hindenburg report, fine. It seemed pretty obvious to me a year ago that this company was a total fraud, but whatever.

            "It'll happen more quickly than you think. I'm betting Anheuser Busch will cancel their truck order. Bosch will liquidate their shares and Milton will sell almost all of his shares. It's unlikely they'll get the energy deal they need in order to produce hydrogen cheaply. It'll be a snowball effect and what seems like a bit of bad news one day will cause it all to crash rapidly.

            "Yeah, they faked stuff like rolling a truck downhill to make it look like they had a working truck. They were showing off a touchscreen interface in a truck that turned out to be a picture saved as the wallpaper on a laptop. They claimed they were producing hydrogen at an impossibly low cost - in reality they had not produced any hydrogen. Milton also purchased designs for the trucks from a student project. None of it was his work.  Everytime something bad happens, it becomes apparent they were lying about everything. When their deal with GM started to unravel, we all got to see that they needed GM to not only produce the Badger, but provide all the battery and engine technology because they didn't have any. When the garbage truck deal fell through, it is again apparent that they lied about their capabilities. There are other companies already making electric garbage trucks, so it's not like it's some impossible dream. Nikola just isn't capable of it.  If you hear anyone from Nikola talk about a new plan or initiative, just know that it doesn't exist.",

You get the feeling that you're talking with an aficionado, or a sommelier when picking out wines. And then there's the fact that they are shifting to more of an online focus.

For robotics: intuitive surgical is the gold standard but has cooled off recently, but teradyne is my conviction buy there. Automation ADSK is #1. Rockwell automation. Most of these companies are somewhat involved in more than one of the sectors I mentioned so the lines get blurry.   Telemedicine: TDOC more sustained value, M3 for potential rocket   Genomics: CRSP, EDIT, NTLA (this last one hasn\u2019t popped as hard yet so good time to enter, room to run)  Cybersecurity: NET, CRWD  3D printing: stratasys   IoT I don\u2019t really have a good single ticker. I have a ton of ETFs like WCLD, SNSR, etc. BOTZ, there are many many ETFs in these sectors you could look up the holdings if you want to dig deeer"

This year I\u2019ve done really well and it\u2019s because I have set goals, abide by them, and if something goes sideways, I don\u2019t stress because no one trade makes up too much of my account.  Three years ago because I had less, I would dedicate too much to just a few trades and if the market turned I was stuck. I didn\u2019t want to sell at huge losses but I also then didn\u2019t have any money to trade with. That led to a lot of stress and emotional (and therefore bad) decisions.  Now if something goes against me, I can just let it sit until it recovers and go about my business.

Have to be catalysts for the next 1-2 years since that is how long my trades go out. Then it\u2019s understanding the risks that would invalidate my thesis which is how i determine my risk tolerance. The winners are the ones that are the clear leader of their group, with the least amount of risk. So for semiconductor companies, the single leader (in my opinion) is Nvidia. Why? Because the fundamentals are super solid, they have a great history of consistently beating earnings, and when you look at the future and where we are going, Nvidias GPUs and DPUs are literally powering that future. Then you look at the risks and the biggest risk is this trade war and supply chain issues. When I compare the bull case to the bear case, the bull case is a much stronger argument. That is how you identify winners. Find the best sectors, best industries, and then the best companies within them. Look at the future and what society needs and the market needs and it will naturally guide you there. I only look at technicals until I have a fully formed investment idea, technicals are just there for entries and exits.   Good way to start is sit down with a blank sheet of paper and think about what our future looks like in 5-10 years then work backwards and figure out which companies will play the biggest most important role in that future.",
            "Well I obviously started in things I thought would grow in the future/tech , Tesla, amd, nvidia. But the real break came when I heard about DraftKings going public through a SPAC merger.

I had known about DraftKings for years and thought it was an absolute beast of a company. Full ATM machine/ print money at will. Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early. Picked some catalyst dates and picked a spread of options with varying risk)My latest and biggest gainer is Gme. I got in June and July at 4$ and just loved all the catalysts that would come for them in the fall with console cycle. Nothing I\u2019ve put money in has come from wsb.

I got pretty obsessed with it and basically spent all day learning and reading about the market. I would spend weeks looking up every single company in the Russel 2000 and doing small DD to decide if it was a good company to get in. I've turned the 20k into 30k which isn't crazy for the bull run we have been on, but I feel so much smarter about investing and finance than I ever have before, and these are things that will certainly help me out in my new job.

            "I am europoor, Balkan Slav, but making OK money on YouTube since June 2020.   Was watching YouTube investment/finance/stock market channels for a long time. Knew about WSB from a few YouTube videos where they talked badly about you autists, but wasn't being active in the sub, or even lurking back then.   My europoor broker app (Revolut) only allows buying and selling of shares. I figured good, because at least I won't gamble my money away on retarded YOLO plays like those WSB autists.  Bought my first stock (HAS) on August 14 2020.  Tried boomervesting, owning 69.4209001 diversified ass shares. After 1.5 months, made $5 profit on a $1000 investment. Fuck that shit. Sold everything off.  Knew about GME stock at that time, cuz I saw Michael Bury owning bigly shares. Become obsessed.    ***\"Why does Big Short guy own this dying company?\"***    Did a detailed DD on my own, back in September, before I even knew this sub was slowly getting obsessed with the same stock I was getting obsessed with.  Became a GME believer right then and there, months before joining WSB. Didn't have the balls to go all in. Fucking idiot. Fucking moron.  Tried the REGN Trump pump. Lost money.   Fuck it - started paperhanding GME on November 17.   Became active in WSB late November/early December. I feel like a retard at home here.  Received hate on WSB for paperhanding GME. Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.  Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.   Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.   Price go up to $14.85. I wait for dip.  Price go up to $15.85. ***I wait for dip***.  Dip to $15.4. ***I FOMO hard YOLO in all my spare cash.***  Own 231 GME shares. Angry at myself because now I own 15 less shares for more money invested.  Monday. GME sleep.  Tuesday. GME moon 25%  Wednesday. GME minimoon 5%  Thursday.

            "Found this sub 4 years ago and started dabbling in stocks on Robinhood. I put about 2000 in my account and was making some decent gains until everyone on here was talking about how RAD was about to enter a merger and it was gonna moon. I remember I had missed out on a lot of big plays this sub was making back then and I pretty much went all in on this one. Rad then dropped from $8 to $4 and $4 to $2 while I kept averaging down. Eventually got out and quit for quiet a while.   But, anyone who has quit before knows you always come back. When I did come back maybe a year later, Robinhood offered options now. So I proceeded to dabble with that even though I had no idea what a call or put was and had no business trading options. Ended up losing another couple hundred and quit for another year and now I\u2019m back again, but this time I\u2019m taking a much safer approach by investing heavily into good stocks like GME.

Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days.

The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating, but the year is estimated through three different approaches: (A) by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, (B) by working backward from the estimation of the start of the ministry of Jesus, and (C) astrological or astronomical alignments. The day or season has been estimated by various methods, including the description of shepherds watching over their sheep.

The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

            "So here\u2019s what I think about timing the Market and the conventional wisdom surrounding it-  Let\u2019s look at last March, for instance, markets dropped about 35% from feb 20 to mar 20.  My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.   I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I\u2019ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year.   Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it\u2019s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options).

Twitter is frenzied about GME too, following Hedgeye's bullish $50 target. Word is out and spreading fast.  With all this in mind, my fully amateur, incompetent, retard prediction is more of the same - opening hour bullishness resulting in big initial price spike/gap up, followed by meek/slow mid-day movement and small dips and rallies by the end of the day for the overall sideways trading pattern. We've rallied hard and fast this week, stonk has to cooldown a bit.  Lowest point is probably $19 Highest is 23, 22 wall is strong and thick and there's another one at 24 behind it, a lot of buys happened during the September q2 earnings dip into the $6 range, a lot of those longs will be exiting at 4x for sure.

With the setup we have, a slow gradual decrease of short interest, which has already been happening lately, followed by a slow gradual increase in price seems like the most likely way this short squeeze is going to effectively play out. That would also make it much less violent, and the price probably can't go super-parabolic, but it will definitely help push it a bit higher than it would be without this massive short accumulation.",

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

            "This is not a good plan. Gamestop would have to be able to reliably turn around aging hardware tech which is not the same thing as used games. Used games, are good until the next console cycle, there is no difference in the new and used game. However what you are describing is a different market, buying outdated tech in the hopes you can resell all of it. You are talking about holding a lot of stock and more importantly the person buying it needs to know what fair value is for each device. This also leave open holes as items go up for sale on huge discounts and people can possibly resell on to Gamestop for profit. Flood Gamestop with a drone that they didn't realize was going obsolete.  Moreover phones are not really part of this opportunity, so you are talking more niche products like drones. Why not phones? Because most phones are on plans and those plans involve turning the phone back over in order to receive the discount on the next upgrade. Even if they were, ask yourself if after the GeekSquad searching laptops fiasco at BestBuy if you really want to turn your phones over to Gamestop employees.  The local delivery angle is a way they can shine, but in your calculations you don't seem to be paying him. In a couple of years it will be 15$ an hour in most major cities cutting hard into the 50$ profit of the delivery itself, you need to make sure you are reselling a drone or gadget every 3 hours.

Very different from a software/data analytics company that no one outside of trading or the industry has heard of.",
            "I am a PLTR long-long but your thesis is weak.  Tendietards don't have the same capital management considerations that Buffett does; one of his major ones being direct return of cash to shareholders. He's a dividend investor, when he isn't buying businesses whole that generate surplus cash.   When Buffett/BRK started getting into KO, it was 1) one of the best brands on earth 2) growing worldwide 3) throwing off a div 4) Somewhat beaten down in price relative to the gleam of its actual business perspective after the Cola Wars and the \"New Coke\" disaster of the 1980s; an AMAZING choice to park large wads of cash for both direct return and potential growth upside. His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE? HOLDING STONKS FOR A LONG TIME CAN MAKE MONEY!\"",
            "The shelf offering of $100 million is less than 5 million shares at current price. It was 6.25 million shares back when the price was $16.   Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.  So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.  I do share at least some of the \"sell before earnings\" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.  But, the losing money argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores.  Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).  If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.  Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.     It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.",

CHWY for comparison has \\~$7 billion of ecommerce sales and is valued at \\~42 billion today (about 6x ecommerce revenues). While CHWY's valuation is based on extreme growth going forward, if we assume that a fair value for an ecommerce company is even half of that multiplier (i.e. 3x online sales), then GME should be worth at least $3 billion today. That doesn't factor in any additional growth that GME is able to create, which could raise sales figures into the billions. even if the company only manages to capture \\~10% of the gaming market (about $175 billion worldwide today), all in ecommerce sales, if we base the value of the company on even a 1x multiplier then the company would be worth $17.5 billion or $265 a share.

            "Yes. Markets generally go down faster than they go up.  Go look at a chart of the SPY (S&amp;P 500). There are always corrections. Buy quality stocks when others \u201cfeel\u201d scared.  Commentators love to talk about how they feel about the market. Don\u2019t care about good or bad feelings.  Healthy companies with little debt will continue to operate and innovate in market decline.    Consider Microsoft as an example: A stock market decline has very little impact on Microsoft\u2019s future with massive profit margins, tons of cash, boatloads of optionality as they ride a growing wave of cloud computing and digital tools.   Yet you could have bought Microsoft in the mid-$100s in February / March 2020. Yeah, the recovery was somewhat unexpectedly quick. But, some idiots sold Microsoft in the mid-$100s. Others  bought the dip. Know the names that you want to get into and have the cash ready.  You likely won\u2019t pick the bottom \u2014 that requires dumb luck \u2014 but a sale is a sale.  Then hold through the recovery and for the long term. Some companies like Microsoft need to get bigger.  They have to. They produce too much cash and therefore they must do ALL of the following: invest internally on long term R&amp;D bets, invest internally on nimble short-term opportunities, buy more companies to grow revenue and profits, give capital back to shareholders with dividend increases, and buy back stock.   What else are they going to do? They are going to get bigger. Hopefully, if they continue to be smart and focused, the stock price will weigh them as more valuable.",

            "Sorry to burst your bubble, but what I'm seeing happening in Canada and now US is nothing but textbook tyrannical socialist autocracy being rolled out slowly and systemically based on the Chinese Maoist communist model, wrapped in the nice looking package of \"we care about you and we're doing this for everyone's safety and well-being, just trust us because we have you best interest at heart\". North America is basically doomed at this point, your leaders have sold you all out and I give it 50 years tops in the best case scenario, before it becomes nothing but a Chinese proxy.  No politician or any 'system figurehead', as I like to call them (think Bill Gates and co.) is selfless, they're self-serving, most of them pricks, a few of them with a smidge of moral compass, but as a whole, they're there to ensure the \"plebs\" are in line, one way or another.  I'm speaking this from a perspective of a dude that was born during a communist regime fallout. I was a baby, so I'd lie if I said I remember anything from firsthand experience other than some fuzzy memories about running from the warzones, but I'm a direct descendant of 2 families that got killed, tortured and oppressed by the marxist ideology, systemically, for decades.  And if you think I'm some right wing nutcase, guess again. I hate fascism at least as equally, because that shit DIRECTLY CAUSED those 50 years of murderous communism in my homeland, on top of a mass genocide of Jews and other 'undesirables', sale of my region to Italy and overall psychotic ideology that was the catalyst for WW2.  I'm a member of a minuscule minority of population who has a drop of sane thought left in their brains in my country. A lot of my peers are radicalized, by left and right wing toxic ideologies. It's psychotic at times. I can't have 2 of my best friends in the same room because they fucking hate each other, because of some fuckwad ideologies from 1945.  I see this same shit being rolled out in North America, right now, under your very noses. Yet you don't see it, because they've perfected their methods and their craft, insidious and elegant, yet evil as fuck at its core.  Divide et impera. Being done right in the open, yet everybody cheers it as hating your neighbor is gonna fix your life's problems.

Have to be catalysts for the next 1-2 years since that is how long my trades go out. Then it\u2019s understanding the risks that would invalidate my thesis which is how i determine my risk tolerance. The winners are the ones that are the clear leader of their group, with the least amount of risk. So for semiconductor companies, the single leader (in my opinion) is Nvidia. Why? Because the fundamentals are super solid, they have a great history of consistently beating earnings, and when you look at the future and where we are going, Nvidias GPUs and DPUs are literally powering that future. Then you look at the risks and the biggest risk is this trade war and supply chain issues. When I compare the bull case to the bear case, the bull case is a much stronger argument. That is how you identify winners. Find the best sectors, best industries, and then the best companies within them. Look at the future and what society needs and the market needs and it will naturally guide you there. I only look at technicals until I have a fully formed investment idea, technicals are just there for entries and exits.

Knew about WSB from a few YouTube videos where they talked badly about you autists, but wasn't being active in the sub, or even lurking back then.   My europoor broker app (Revolut) only allows buying and selling of shares. I figured good, because at least I won't gamble my money away on retarded YOLO plays like those WSB autists.  Bought my first stock (HAS) on August 14 2020.  Tried boomervesting, owning 69.4209001 diversified ass shares. After 1.5 months, made $5 profit on a $1000 investment. Fuck that shit.

Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.  Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.   Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.   Price go up to $14.85. I wait for dip.  Price go up to $15.85. ***I wait for dip***.  Dip to $15.4. ***I FOMO hard YOLO in all my spare cash.***  Own 231 GME shares.

I put about 2000 in my account and was making some decent gains until everyone on here was talking about how RAD was about to enter a merger and it was gonna moon. I remember I had missed out on a lot of big plays this sub was making back then and I pretty much went all in on this one. Rad then dropped from $8 to $4 and $4 to $2 while I kept averaging down. Eventually got out and quit for quiet a while.   But, anyone who has quit before knows you always come back. When I did come back maybe a year later, Robinhood offered options now. So I proceeded to dabble with that even though I had no idea what a call or put was and had no business trading options. Ended up losing another couple hundred and quit for another year and now I\u2019m back again, but this time I\u2019m taking a much safer approach by investing heavily into good stocks like GME.

Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days.

The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating, but the year is estimated through three different approaches: (A) by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, (B) by working backward from the estimation of the start of the ministry of Jesus, and (C) astrological or astronomical alignments. The day or season has been estimated by various methods, including the description of shepherds watching over their sheep.

The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

Hopefully higher. It\u2019ll happen quickly too imo...jnj and ko are heavily weighted all the equity etfs getting flows....dividend, value, and the total stock market etfs..they also do better in a falling rate environment and have basically no reason to sell right now.

They also have positive earnings catalysts for q1...vaccine, pent up demand for elective surgery and a lower dollar for jnj....lower dollar, stimulus,and reopening story for coke....rgnx is a good small cap growth stock to have to complement my dividend plays.. it is also in a lot of popular etfs and i just believe biotech is going to be really strong going into next year.

            "So here\u2019s what I think about timing the Market and the conventional wisdom surrounding it-  Let\u2019s look at last March, for instance, markets dropped about 35% from feb 20 to mar 20.  My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.   I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I\u2019m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I\u2019ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year.   Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it\u2019s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options).

            "I know we're made to believe from all the gain porns that hopping from stock to stock as it gets hot is the way to make big money but the truth is, it doesn't work for the majority of people.  Has it worked for you?  If not, and you want something with HIGH HIGH probability of getting HOT HOT, this is definitely it.   How long of a wait? A few weeks at the most. A couple of catalysts:  Cohen or any savvy person knows you gotta strike the iron while it's hot.  I don't see any reason to wait, but he did have to wait until the next year so the profit incurring from the squeezes is cancelled out by expenses incurred in order to acquire more than 50% of the business in shares/options as well as the expenses incurred from acquiring the business.

Sherman will spend Christmas and New Years crafting the January earnings report with that on his mind. RC calls the tune, and Sherman is dancing like a white Boomer at a Bee Gees tribute concert.

            "$20 is the clear support here, downward momentum got rejected hard today at that price, multiple times, just like the upward momentum got rejected at 22 yesterday, also multiple times. Sideways movement seems most likely for the next week, unless Daddy Cohen graces us with another \"over 9000\" 13D meme.  Bearish sentiment is slowly waning, and their hit pieces like that Motley Tool article earlier today and that retarded Shilling Alpha short thesis yesterday are edging on self-parody at this point.

Twitter is frenzied about GME too, following Hedgeye's bullish $50 target. Word is out and spreading fast.  With all this in mind, my fully amateur, incompetent, retard prediction is more of the same - opening hour bullishness resulting in big initial price spike/gap up, followed by meek/slow mid-day movement and small dips and rallies by the end of the day for the overall sideways trading pattern. We've rallied hard and fast this week, stonk has to cooldown a bit.  Lowest point is probably $19 Highest is 23, 22 wall is strong and thick and there's another one at 24 behind it, a lot of buys happened during the September q2 earnings dip into the $6 range, a lot of those longs will be exiting at 4x for sure.

With the setup we have, a slow gradual decrease of short interest, which has already been happening lately, followed by a slow gradual increase in price seems like the most likely way this short squeeze is going to effectively play out. That would also make it much less violent, and the price probably can't go super-parabolic, but it will definitely help push it a bit higher than it would be without this massive short accumulation.",

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

            "This is not a good plan. Gamestop would have to be able to reliably turn around aging hardware tech which is not the same thing as used games. Used games, are good until the next console cycle, there is no difference in the new and used game. However what you are describing is a different market, buying outdated tech in the hopes you can resell all of it. You are talking about holding a lot of stock and more importantly the person buying it needs to know what fair value is for each device. This also leave open holes as items go up for sale on huge discounts and people can possibly resell on to Gamestop for profit. Flood Gamestop with a drone that they didn't realize was going obsolete.  Moreover phones are not really part of this opportunity, so you are talking more niche products like drones. Why not phones? Because most phones are on plans and those plans involve turning the phone back over in order to receive the discount on the next upgrade. Even if they were, ask yourself if after the GeekSquad searching laptops fiasco at BestBuy if you really want to turn your phones over to Gamestop employees.  The local delivery angle is a way they can shine, but in your calculations you don't seem to be paying him. In a couple of years it will be 15$ an hour in most major cities cutting hard into the 50$ profit of the delivery itself, you need to make sure you are reselling a drone or gadget every 3 hours.

His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE? HOLDING STONKS FOR A LONG TIME CAN MAKE MONEY!\"",
            "The shelf offering of $100 million is less than 5 million shares at current price. It was 6.25 million shares back when the price was $16.   Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.  So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.  I do share at least some of the \"sell before earnings\" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.  But, the losing money argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores.  Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).  If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.  Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.     It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.",

CHWY for comparison has \\~$7 billion of ecommerce sales and is valued at \\~42 billion today (about 6x ecommerce revenues). While CHWY's valuation is based on extreme growth going forward, if we assume that a fair value for an ecommerce company is even half of that multiplier (i.e. 3x online sales), then GME should be worth at least $3 billion today. That doesn't factor in any additional growth that GME is able to create, which could raise sales figures into the billions. even if the company only manages to capture \\~10% of the gaming market (about $175 billion worldwide today), all in ecommerce sales, if we base the value of the company on even a 1x multiplier then the company would be worth $17.5 billion or $265 a share.

            "Yes. Markets generally go down faster than they go up.  Go look at a chart of the SPY (S&amp;P 500). There are always corrections. Buy quality stocks when others \u201cfeel\u201d scared.  Commentators love to talk about how they feel about the market. Don\u2019t care about good or bad feelings.  Healthy companies with little debt will continue to operate and innovate in market decline.    Consider Microsoft as an example: A stock market decline has very little impact on Microsoft\u2019s future with massive profit margins, tons of cash, boatloads of optionality as they ride a growing wave of cloud computing and digital tools.   Yet you could have bought Microsoft in the mid-$100s in February / March 2020. Yeah, the recovery was somewhat unexpectedly quick. But, some idiots sold Microsoft in the mid-$100s. Others  bought the dip. Know the names that you want to get into and have the cash ready.  You likely won\u2019t pick the bottom \u2014 that requires dumb luck \u2014 but a sale is a sale.  Then hold through the recovery and for the long term. Some companies like Microsoft need to get bigger.  They have to. They produce too much cash and therefore they must do ALL of the following: invest internally on long term R&amp;D bets, invest internally on nimble short-term opportunities, buy more companies to grow revenue and profits, give capital back to shareholders with dividend increases, and buy back stock.   What else are they going to do? They are going to get bigger. Hopefully, if they continue to be smart and focused, the stock price will weigh them as more valuable.",

So, even if he did truly pump and dump, he chose the worst possible moment to do so, so I guess that would be karma or sumshit, I dunno...  u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT you can join in on this drama at any point mate so we can hear your side of the story.  #",

            "The shelf offering of $100 million is less than 5 million shares at current price. It was 6.25 million shares back when the price was $16.   Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.  So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.  I do share at least some of the \"sell before earnings\" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.  But, the losing money argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores.  Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).  If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.  Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.     It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.",

Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.  So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.  I do share at least some of the \"sell before earnings\" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.  But, the losing money argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores.  Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).  If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.  Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.     It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.",
            "Sigh,  tl;dr:  don't buy the dip because this is not the lowest it will hit, INSTITUTES AND FUNDS are getting the fuck out because they aren't retards. You want to see results of Peak Capitalist vs Big Brother then go look at the history of US vs Rockefeller, nobody wants anything to do with that.  don't sell if you are already owning stocks because BABA's net revenue and source of income does not get affected by power struggle, it will recover back to 250 and beyond when the politics ends with a winner.",
            "Not to sound like a boomer but yea, if you're just buying S&amp;p500 youd still have gains if you bought at the peak before the covid drop.",
            "Bro that\u2019s the pump part in a pump and dumb, you can\u2019t pump a stock that is already at its peak",

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks."

I expect the streaming news will be significant and it will drive the stock higher. My comparison is to the 2019 investor day when we first got a real picture of the Disney streaming story. My trade is in part based on expectations being much lower than Disney and they over delivering in a big way. I think the upside could be greater than a 10-15% move post investor day. Also betting on a run up to investor day as we get more info but I like how they are doing new Star Trek and building on the franchises they own. I see the streaming wars going 1 DIS 2 VIAC and that\u2019s a big part of the trade the street will just realize this on or even a few days after investor day 2021.",

They aren\u2019t compete with Netflix as much as compete against HBO Max Peacock and the smaller services, Netflix has a different product that\u2019s more broad than anyone else. Showtime will compete against HBO which has a lack of leadership. Disney is competing more with their bundle against Netflix at a high price point. the SVOD business is wide open and I\u2019m even more bullish on Fast and Showtime. We don\u2019t have enough info on Paramount Plus 2 year slate which is the entire reason there is outsized upside on the trade. It\u2019s a show me now story.

            "Not really given they are a newly merged company A lot of the high growth assets are either new IE Pluto or new for major growth shifts IE showtime and CBS. I expect the streaming news will be significant and it will drive the stock higher. My comparison is to the 2019 investor day when we first got a real picture of the Disney streaming story. My trade is in part based on expectations being much lower than Disney and they over delivering in a big way. I think the upside could be greater than a 10-15% move post investor day. Also betting on a run up to investor day as we get more info but I like how they are doing new Star Trek and building on the franchises they own. I see the streaming wars going 1 DIS 2 VIAC and that\u2019s a big part of the trade the street will just realize this on or even a few days after investor day 2021.",

            "As paramount plus rolls out next year I think youll see a difference in some of those issues but Netflix overall is a very expensive streaming play to invest in and they will still use a large portion of ViacomCBS content in the catalog. They aren\u2019t compete with Netflix as much as compete against HBO Max Peacock and the smaller services, Netflix has a different product that\u2019s more broad than anyone else. Showtime will compete against HBO which has a lack of leadership. Disney is competing more with their bundle against Netflix at a high price point. the SVOD business is wide open and I\u2019m even more bullish on Fast and Showtime. We don\u2019t have enough info on Paramount Plus 2 year slate which is the entire reason there is outsized upside on the trade. It\u2019s a show me now story. So once you see the slate you can make up your mind. I\u2019ve seen enough and know where I\u2019m placing bets.",

            "There's no way no property taxes would fly.  Every locality is practically forced to enforce them. With no actual way for the feds to stop it.  The gst will destroy everyone who lives on a fixed income.  Ie largest % of the nation.  Because yes a typically thought of \"middle class income\". At 50k non-gross.   Is \"fixed\" after one financially endebetures themselves.  Then refinances those credit cards + student loans. Into a fixed and managed debt repayment plan.  If **all** property taxes became **enforceably** illegal.   And, you had the IRS and Treasury sending the Secret Service.   After every municipal politburo. Who got cute on Uncle Sam.   Trying to pass property taxes through any means. To double-dip+.   Then maybe that could be viable.   As, i've never seen a way to enforce the GST.   Even if we passed a Constitutional Ammendment.   To block the States capabilities to just write their own,  - \"F you rest of the USA Ammendments\"  - Ie \"We enjoy no tariffs, or other remittances.\"  - Ie \"We wave away federal protections. By State constitutional amendment.\"   - Then, we'll, \"Bad State\". Tax residents a property tax.   At least *one* State will get it through.   Matter of marketing, ignorance (time), and greed.   20-25 yrs of passable observance. Then, wel have a double or triple tax.   Regressively based, and practical every locality will be jumping for it.   \"Free money\" that would sure be nice to monopolise. When everyone else does it too.  No *way to fail* and that's a **failure**.  That's why GST is untenable.   It doesn't fit within our foundational structure.  Its inversely engineered.   - Blocks our controls on abuse. Otherwise inbuilt.   - Ie malfeasance.   Instead of,   - Controls on malfeasance.   - By increasing capital flow.   - Ie direct disbursements, paid out \"guaranteed\".   - A step removed. From SINGLE wrongdoing localities.  Stoping a trending towards fiefdom. Eliminating total monopolies.  Ie property taxes,  - Raised to fix their own failures.   Instead of fixing what they can by *themselves*.   Then,   - Reaching out for the rest of the nation to build them up further.   - Ie grants, etc.   If something is truly out of reach. Their need remains, so OUR issue remains.   It will **be met** so long as the nation can meet it.   The GST would take away that leg up. From as needed grants, federally.   Losing tariffs, and a de-conglomerated financial pipeline. From top-down.   We could increase cashflow accross board.   Ie,  - Post-residents gaining a small regular cashflow.   This *guaranteed flow*.   Keeps large debt payments. From draining stagnant incomes.   ``` Residents money -&gt; elsewhere  Per resident,  resourcesNewToTax &lt; resourcesOldToTax  propertyTaxes++ while taxableResources-- ```   This,  In a locality that sees no realistic appreciation.   - Ie most of our nation's small towns.   Then,   Death spirals occur. In population, investiture, and appreciation.  A cashflow through a guaranteed income. Even small, buys us time.  Allowing *on* 'spiral' **start**.   Congress time++ to react. With our existing procedures for assistance.  Keeping the \"death\" out of the equation."

But never believed in my plays that ran no matter how many times I was proved right.   Throughout the month of august until now I have bought nothing and I\u2019m down to my last $700 cause bills raping me, everyday I tell myself I\u2019ll buy, I\u2019ll trust my gut, and fight with myself etc, and nothing changes. My parents think I have my money still and I have not spoke to any friends in months. I never thought I\u2019d let myself get this far down everyday since July 24th I wake up at 7 and watch the market until close and have done nothing but not trust my gut and it\u2019s fucked me over.   And I\u2019m at my last leg of desperation, my dealer offered to buy my car back 15-18k and I\u2019m gonna sell it. Deposit all of it in RH, turn on margin and start trading. I will either dig myself out of this hole or lose it all and Kill myself, no exceptions.",

            "There's no way no property taxes would fly.  Every locality is practically forced to enforce them. With no actual way for the feds to stop it.  The gst will destroy everyone who lives on a fixed income.  Ie largest % of the nation.  Because yes a typically thought of \"middle class income\". At 50k non-gross.   Is \"fixed\" after one financially endebetures themselves.  Then refinances those credit cards + student loans. Into a fixed and managed debt repayment plan.  If **all** property taxes became **enforceably** illegal.   And, you had the IRS and Treasury sending the Secret Service.   After every municipal politburo. Who got cute on Uncle Sam.   Trying to pass property taxes through any means. To double-dip+.   Then maybe that could be viable.   As, i've never seen a way to enforce the GST.   Even if we passed a Constitutional Ammendment.   To block the States capabilities to just write their own,  - \"F you rest of the USA Ammendments\"  - Ie \"We enjoy no tariffs, or other remittances.\"  - Ie \"We wave away federal protections. By State constitutional amendment.\"   - Then, we'll, \"Bad State\". Tax residents a property tax.   At least *one* State will get it through.   Matter of marketing, ignorance (time), and greed.   20-25 yrs of passable observance. Then, wel have a double or triple tax.   Regressively based, and practical every locality will be jumping for it.   \"Free money\" that would sure be nice to monopolise. When everyone else does it too.  No *way to fail* and that's a **failure**.  That's why GST is untenable.   It doesn't fit within our foundational structure.  Its inversely engineered.   - Blocks our controls on abuse. Otherwise inbuilt.   - Ie malfeasance.   Instead of,   - Controls on malfeasance.   - By increasing capital flow.   - Ie direct disbursements, paid out \"guaranteed\".   - A step removed. From SINGLE wrongdoing localities.  Stoping a trending towards fiefdom. Eliminating total monopolies.  Ie property taxes,  - Raised to fix their own failures.   Instead of fixing what they can by *themselves*.   Then,   - Reaching out for the rest of the nation to build them up further.   - Ie grants, etc.   If something is truly out of reach. Their need remains, so OUR issue remains.   It will **be met** so long as the nation can meet it.   The GST would take away that leg up. From as needed grants, federally.   Losing tariffs, and a de-conglomerated financial pipeline. From top-down.   We could increase cashflow accross board.   Ie,  - Post-residents gaining a small regular cashflow.   This *guaranteed flow*.   Keeps large debt payments. From draining stagnant incomes.   ``` Residents money -&gt; elsewhere  Per resident,  resourcesNewToTax &lt; resourcesOldToTax  propertyTaxes++ while taxableResources-- ```   This,  In a locality that sees no realistic appreciation.   - Ie most of our nation's small towns.   Then,   Death spirals occur. In population, investiture, and appreciation.  A cashflow through a guaranteed income. Even small, buys us time.  Allowing *on* 'spiral' **start**.   Congress time++ to react. With our existing procedures for assistance.  Keeping the \"death\" out of the equation."

Ford never really panned out, but Chevron did and I/we sold around $30 profit/share. When I turned 18 is when I hopped on robinhood, made some gains here and there buying low and selling high on some small company stocks.   I was in Engineering in college but then decided it wasn\u2019t my thing, switched to a Supply Chain major which involved taking a shitload of Accounting, Finance, Management, and etc type classes where I learned a bit about Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Risk Management. Made a rookie move back in March and sold as soon as I heard COVID was coming, didn\u2019t buy back in either (I was holding Tesla and Apple, for some reason turned bearish). Learned my lesson from that. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research/analysis and picking options without putting any actual money in them because losing a few hundred is devastating to a college student and I\u2019m not as ballsy as some of you fuckers.

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

It's a good idea because:  1) Can't dodge the tax. No amount of spending on accountants will enable you to dodge that 28% GST.  2) No need for tariffs... Just reduce the GST on goods you want to promote to the consumer.  3) No need for tax rebates. Just lower the GST on the goods/service that those people would use.  3) No government waste running the tax agency. 4) lack of capital gains taxes will make country attractive to investors 5) lack of property taxes would... Again... Make country attractive to investors. 6) lack of a corporate taxes would attract corporate headquarters. 7) People and companies decide how much money they pay in taxes by reducing consumption and paying for products with low GST.  8) Everyone knows what is going on.",

            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes. So yeah hopefully this time it sticks.",

It's a good idea because:  1) Can't dodge the tax. No amount of spending on accountants will enable you to dodge that 28% GST.  2) No need for tariffs... Just reduce the GST on goods you want to promote to the consumer.  3) No need for tax rebates. Just lower the GST on the goods/service that those people would use.  3) No government waste running the tax agency. 4) lack of capital gains taxes will make country attractive to investors 5) lack of property taxes would... Again... Make country attractive to investors. 6) lack of a corporate taxes would attract corporate headquarters. 7) People and companies decide how much money they pay in taxes by reducing consumption and paying for products with low GST.  8) Everyone knows what is going on.",

My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&amp;P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don\u2019t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I wouldn\u2019t think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.    I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.    Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren\u2019t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don\u2019t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?  Conventional wisdom allows average Joe\u2019s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found.   Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you\u2019d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better.

Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line.

I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed.

Panic sold the next 5% Market bottoms and at that point I am so shit scared to lose everything I wait to get in until April.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

It's possible because hedge fund shorts literally thought Covid lockdown will bankrupt gamestop but they didn't do their homework and fell aslept at the wheel. 3. You absolutely will.

Hmmm thinking about IV got me wondering... with GME being the meme stock it is, if scalpers spread 'believable' rumors to profit. Today, even 0dte was pricy imo. The shorts can conspire like this too I suppose, to create 'disappointment' to cause a sell off and take some steam out of the wsb train. This might have been what happened today.

Then hold through the recovery and for the long term. Some companies like Microsoft need to get bigger.  They have to. They produce too much cash and therefore they must do ALL of the following: invest internally on long term R&amp;D bets, invest internally on nimble short-term opportunities, buy more companies to grow revenue and profits, give capital back to shareholders with dividend increases, and buy back stock.   What else are they going to do? They are going to get bigger. Hopefully, if they continue to be smart and focused, the stock price will weigh them as more valuable.",

Decided I was going to actively manage in Sept of 2019. In February of 2020 decided the 30% gain I had made in 3 years was too good to be true and went all cash, yes I said February. When markets started to go south I thought holy fuck I am literally the smartest person alive and I can buy this massive 10% dip! Panic sold after next 5%. Holy fuck another 10% dip to buy! Panic sold the next 5% Market bottoms and at that point I am so shit scared to lose everything I wait to get in until April.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",

So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months. Can't wait to see what 2021 will bring, definitely holding everything right now (diamond hand gang).",

            "Most important thing is fundamentals first. The fundamentals have to be solid and the story has to make sense. Have to be catalysts for the next 1-2 years since that is how long my trades go out. Then it\u2019s understanding the risks that would invalidate my thesis which is how i determine my risk tolerance. The winners are the ones that are the clear leader of their group, with the least amount of risk. So for semiconductor companies, the single leader (in my opinion) is Nvidia. Why? Because the fundamentals are super solid, they have a great history of consistently beating earnings, and when you look at the future and where we are going, Nvidias GPUs and DPUs are literally powering that future. Then you look at the risks and the biggest risk is this trade war and supply chain issues. When I compare the bull case to the bear case, the bull case is a much stronger argument. That is how you identify winners. Find the best sectors, best industries, and then the best companies within them. Look at the future and what society needs and the market needs and it will naturally guide you there. I only look at technicals until I have a fully formed investment idea, technicals are just there for entries and exits.   Good way to start is sit down with a blank sheet of paper and think about what our future looks like in 5-10 years then work backwards and figure out which companies will play the biggest most important role in that future.",
            "Well I obviously started in things I thought would grow in the future/tech , Tesla, amd, nvidia. But the real break came when I heard about DraftKings going public through a SPAC merger. Had no idea what that even was but it allowed me to start making bigger bets and It was the company that got me into options, which obviously are the biggest part of my gains. I had known about DraftKings for years and thought it was an absolute beast of a company. Full ATM machine/ print money at will. Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early. Picked some catalyst dates and picked a spread of options with varying risk)My latest and biggest gainer is Gme. I got in June and July at 4$ and just loved all the catalysts that would come for them in the fall with console cycle. Nothing I\u2019ve put money in has come from wsb.

I was holding NVDA at the time and some other stocks but NVDA took most of my money since i sold at a loss fearing i was never going to make my money back. Sometime in 2019 I was unemployed and started trading shares again. This time making minimal profits. Some $30 or $15. Very minuscule profits but it paid for my weed and gas. Fast forward to 2020, I jumped back into trading after a few months of having my account collect dust because I learned about options trading. Saw a few videos on youtube and said fuck it why not. Dont really know what all this gamma, vega, delta bullshit is but here goes nothing. And so far its been going better than i expected it to be.

BTW, $20 ended up being a massive limit buy price, a lot of longs piled in, the price briefly dipped below and then just strong bounce back into the $20.05-$20.15 territory.

After having enough capital, switched to selling options to decrease my risk substantially, after reaching that amount (and recently enabling PM), there's really no need to take any more significant risks. I now have enough to pay off my future medical school loans and then some. Will still continue selling options to take advantage of this ridiculous environment while it lasts.",

Even they can no longer spout the usual shortie bullshit, too many of their readers have already awoken to the truth, so they basically write a neutral-leaning-slightly-bullish article, but then title it in a way that it sounds like buying the dip is a bad bet, hoping to sway title-only-readers into the bearish attitude.  BTW, $20 ended up being a massive limit buy price, a lot of longs piled in, the price briefly dipped below and then just strong bounce back into the $20.05-$20.15 territory.  This is actually good fucking news, because the $20 support from December 22, 2:30 PM held strong and didn't let the bears drill it any lower.  Lets see what last 5 minutes bring",

Just lower the GST on the goods/service that those people would use.  3) No government waste running the tax agency. 4) lack of capital gains taxes will make country attractive to investors 5) lack of property taxes would...

            "Last Year a lady hit the back of my car and totalled my car. The check that I received from her insurance company I decided to finally invest. A friend told me about Robinhood so I went and bought a google share and other vanguard for dividends. 1-2 months later, I installed reddit and joined r/stocks and investings and found out about r/wallstreetbets. This is where it became interesting. I would see peoples post of 700% gains, 2,000% gains. And I got so excited! So Without knowing anything about options, I bought my first Spy Call expiring in a week. That was when Covid happened and stock crashed. After I bought spy puts, it went back up and I started being happy. Bought RCL puts. Was happy my money was recovering. And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it. And lost it all recently buying PLTR Calls and it crashed. Anyways. Thats my story. Just had to vent and get it off my chest, its been bothering me for a really long time for being this autistic.

I work in sales and some of my customers (oil and gas, airline, hockey teams) have also been directly impacted by COVID, falling oil prices, BLM (defunding the police) and knowing about stock goes hand in hand with knowing about the world you live in, what's happening globally and which direction the future is headed and all of this is fascinating to me.

Articles about RH and WSB piqued my interest. Made a deposit 10/1 and am 4x now. PLTR and various ARK related picks to thank.

            "I nominate myself for ROTY retard. Stumbled upon this site in December from r/conspiracy as The Big Short was one of my favorite movies and over there we knew how fucked rona was gonna be before mainstream got a hold of it.   Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k. Started a TDA with 1k, still fucked up, but did better, at 5k and with a solid understanding that I\u2019m still a retard.   So, how long before I\u2019m profitable? Who knows. Can\u2019t do math. Down 13k (95%) on old account up 2k on new account. Won\u2019t take long considering new account I\u2019m heavy in the four horsemen, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME. Shares and leaps. Cheers you guys.

Took about a month before I was actually approved to begin trading and put in $300 in a few Delta and AMD shares. Sold those for a minor profit.  And during that time a lot of posts from here would pop up occasionally in popular for me as I browsed so I\u2019d lurk around confused about what it was about. The memes really drew me in though.  Learned about options and lost all of my gains. Until recently when I saw the DD post of PLTR while it was at $15. I said fuck it and deposit what I had in my savings to buy shares and leaps.  Aaaand. Now we\u2019re here. Got $2k profit so far so that\u2019s kinda cool.

Now I use a Vanguard ETFs but place 1-3% total portfolio value bets on individual stocks and let them run. Used FAANG for a while with solid returns. Doubled my money on Roku way back...should not have sold it at 60. In the last 5 years I'm up 125% vs sp500 96%. Only 345% Tesla gains from 10 shares.  I'm not permitted to trade options but got lucky and bought 200 shares of PLTR at $9.54 right before I started paying attention to this sub.

Fast forward to this year I find out my brother in the states (pursuing his Masters) is trading stocks on Webull. I convince him to purchase some Tesla shares pre split, at the moment those shares have doubled. I also predicted that other EV stocks such as XPEV will also blow up due to Tesla. Also prompted him on PLTR when they listed back in September. After seeing all these stocks go up I urgently needed to get my own trading account.

            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",
            "I'm 20, had a lot of financial classes this academic year so I finally decided having a savings account is retarded and I need to invest. So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months. Can't wait to see what 2021 will bring, definitely holding everything right now (diamond hand gang).",

            "36 y/o teacher looking to get rich since I\u2019ve plateaued income-wise. I started in early 2018 when I saw you motherfuckers talking about yachts. When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed.

I thought I was already over diversified. Lol  I\u2019m eying the meme stock PLTR. Buying about 1,000 shares. Good idea?",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

            "I am a PLTR long-long but your thesis is weak.  Tendietards don't have the same capital management considerations that Buffett does; one of his major ones being direct return of cash to shareholders. He's a dividend investor, when he isn't buying businesses whole that generate surplus cash.   When Buffett/BRK started getting into KO, it was 1) one of the best brands on earth 2) growing worldwide 3) throwing off a div 4) Somewhat beaten down in price relative to the gleam of its actual business perspective after the Cola Wars and the \"New Coke\" disaster of the 1980s; an AMAZING choice to park large wads of cash for both direct return and potential growth upside. His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE? HOLDING STONKS FOR A LONG TIME CAN MAKE MONEY!\"",
            "\"Pltr stock in the 2020s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all data analyzed by corporations on planet earth was/is a pltr product.

At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.   Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition. When the deal closes (likely in my view) the stock will trade up to the take out price and you\u2019ll get cash. Don\u2019t be stupid. Some deals are very very risky. Only invest in what you understand. There\u2019s always risk.  You just have to decide \u2014 is it risk that you can sleep with? Don\u2019t do anything without really understanding this question.   Take your time. There\u2019s no hurry. The trade will 95% still be there tomorrow or will come around again.  Do the work. Me, a stock broker, your brother\u2019s friend, and zillions of people on the Internet have stock picks ideas. We aren\u2019t responsible for your decisions \u2014 and not everyone knows what they are talking about. In fact most don\u2019t. Any idiot can buy PLTR because it\u2019s trending on WSBs. Do they really understand how governments buy their software, how they can grow, and how defensible their technology is?  Most people have no idea. You have to do research and read a lot. There\u2019s no substitute for hard work. If you don\u2019t have the time and inclination to do research, that\u2019s 100% okay too. Just buy an index and live your life. Don\u2019t gamble on stocks you aren\u2019t interested in learning about. Sometimes you will lose money, sometimes you will make money.   Even Amazon was down more than 80% at one point. All you can do is move forward. The market doesn\u2019t care about your cost basis. Just try to make smart, reasoned decisions and you\u2019ll be fine.

Lost the majority of my account in April by being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and it\u2019s Been a slow bleed out ever since. Retirement accounts have had a few great plays suck as PLTR, NIO , DAL. Down to my final $300 in my original account, praying VALE to the moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
            "Started by buying beaten down Indian stocks then bought 4 shares of citi, 1 share of pltr and 1 share of jpm. Gains aren't much but atleast I am crying a river about my losses.",
            "I nominate myself for ROTY retard. Stumbled upon this site in December from r/conspiracy as The Big Short was one of my favorite movies and over there we knew how fucked rona was gonna be before mainstream got a hold of it.   Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k.   TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k. Started a TDA with 1k, still fucked up, but did better, at 5k and with a solid understanding that I\u2019m still a retard.   So, how long before I\u2019m profitable? Who knows. Can\u2019t do math. Down 13k (95%) on old account up 2k on new account. Won\u2019t take long considering new account I\u2019m heavy in the four horsemen, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME. Shares and leaps. Cheers you guys. Happy Holidays and thanks for the 13k, and counting, tuition fee.",
            "I started by buying CCL when it dropped down to $15 in April. Sold at like $20 when it briefly bounced back up. Sat on it for months, didn't have time to do DD.

            "This year around a few days before the crash. I don\u2019t know if I just saw something on the news regarding said crash or what but I had this urge to want to start a portfolio.  Took about a month before I was actually approved to begin trading and put in $300 in a few Delta and AMD shares. Sold those for a minor profit.  And during that time a lot of posts from here would pop up occasionally in popular for me as I browsed so I\u2019d lurk around confused about what it was about. The memes really drew me in though.  Learned about options and lost all of my gains. Until recently when I saw the DD post of PLTR while it was at $15. I said fuck it and deposit what I had in my savings to buy shares and leaps.  Aaaand. Now we\u2019re here. Got $2k profit so far so that\u2019s kinda cool. Still holding onto those calls even though they\u2019re not as strong as that initial bull run. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 (rockets added because this is WSB after all.)",
            "Started back in the 2008 Financial crisis, kept buying and selling etrade stock timing dead cat bounces based on fed announcements. Dumb strategy but was up 30% when I stopped and bought a mutual fund...the fund lost 50% in a year. I dabbled in a few stocks here and there for a while but was broke bagging groceries for a living with a 4 year degree.  Got a job in finance in 2011, bought some individual stocks that were still undervalued here and there. Tried letting a firm manage the money but it cost too much for the value. Now I use a Vanguard ETFs but place 1-3% total portfolio value bets on individual stocks and let them run. Used FAANG for a while with solid returns. Doubled my money on Roku way back...should not have sold it at 60. In the last 5 years I'm up 125% vs sp500 96%. Only 345% Tesla gains from 10 shares.  I'm not permitted to trade options but got lucky and bought 200 shares of PLTR at $9.54 right before I started paying attention to this sub. Funny to watch but I'd never YOLO...aggressive growth but no rampant speculation.  Total assets in 2009 3k...as of today 236k.  Yeah I'm that boring buy and hold a few years at least guy...but I'm likley to retire at 59 with 1.3 million.",

            "Always wanted to trade stocks but the cost of signing up with traditional brokerage firms turned me off. After finding out about Robinhood and Webull they were also a let down since they don\u2019t operate in my country. Fast forward to this year I find out my brother in the states (pursuing his Masters) is trading stocks on Webull. I convince him to purchase some Tesla shares pre split, at the moment those shares have doubled. I also predicted that other EV stocks such as XPEV will also blow up due to Tesla. Also prompted him on PLTR when they listed back in September. After seeing all these stocks go up I urgently needed to get my own trading account. Then comes TD Ameritrade to save the day opened my trading account at the beginning of this month. Best part as a foreigner I think capital gains tax are paid on only dividends.",
            "TLDR: Started mid 2019. Worst down 30%. Best up 15%. Currently down 7%.     Up until a few years ago I had maybe a few thousand dollars in my bank. Just enough to pay bills and have enough padding for maybe a month or two to live off of. Worked a lot of over time, saved up, went to college. Finished college and landed a very nice paying job but kept the same lifestyle so about 80% of my income is disposable. All debt paid off and no kids or family to support.  In mid 2019 decided it was time to stop letting my money decay in shitty bank accounts and bought some safe/boring total market ETFs. Then in march 2020 we started getting some massive red days. I said fuck it to being a passive investor and pulled everything out about half way from the bottom. Bought a couple hundred shares of GME around $3 as my first actual stock purchases during that time. Discovered WSB shortly after.  Since then I've DCA back into sp500 ETFs. Bought stock in PLAY, SAVE, and HSE.TO, all of which are up quite a bit. I also messed around with options. Lost $6k on a NKLA weekly put and learned a little about 700% IV premiums. Got crushed on AAPL in sept. Made a bit back with MSFT and PLTR calls.  All said and done, I'm down 7% in total. At my best I was up 15% and worst down 30%. The worst times taught me about risk tolerance and really showed me how taxing investing can be on mental health. I'm content to be where I'm at right now as I've learned some valuable lessons that'll probably pay off in the future.",
            "I'm 20, had a lot of financial classes this academic year so I finally decided having a savings account is retarded and I need to invest. So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months. Can't wait to see what 2021 will bring, definitely holding everything right now (diamond hand gang).",

            "36 y/o teacher looking to get rich since I\u2019ve plateaued income-wise. I started in early 2018 when I saw you motherfuckers talking about yachts. When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "Interesting about Roku. I never use it. Only Netflix. Do you think it\u2019s the future?  Good to know you have 80 stocks. I have 200k invested with only 25 stocks so far. I thought I was already over diversified. Lol  I\u2019m eying the meme stock PLTR. Buying about 1,000 shares. Good idea?",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

            "I am a PLTR long-long but your thesis is weak.  Tendietards don't have the same capital management considerations that Buffett does; one of his major ones being direct return of cash to shareholders. He's a dividend investor, when he isn't buying businesses whole that generate surplus cash.   When Buffett/BRK started getting into KO, it was 1) one of the best brands on earth 2) growing worldwide 3) throwing off a div 4) Somewhat beaten down in price relative to the gleam of its actual business perspective after the Cola Wars and the \"New Coke\" disaster of the 1980s; an AMAZING choice to park large wads of cash for both direct return and potential growth upside. His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE? HOLDING STONKS FOR A LONG TIME CAN MAKE MONEY!\"",
            "\"Pltr stock in the 2020s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all data analyzed by corporations on planet earth was/is a pltr product.

At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It\u2019s a tremendous company.   Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition. When the deal closes (likely in my view) the stock will trade up to the take out price and you\u2019ll get cash. Don\u2019t be stupid. Some deals are very very risky. Only invest in what you understand. There\u2019s always risk.  You just have to decide \u2014 is it risk that you can sleep with? Don\u2019t do anything without really understanding this question.   Take your time. There\u2019s no hurry. The trade will 95% still be there tomorrow or will come around again.  Do the work. Me, a stock broker, your brother\u2019s friend, and zillions of people on the Internet have stock picks ideas. We aren\u2019t responsible for your decisions \u2014 and not everyone knows what they are talking about. In fact most don\u2019t. Any idiot can buy PLTR because it\u2019s trending on WSBs. Do they really understand how governments buy their software, how they can grow, and how defensible their technology is?  Most people have no idea. You have to do research and read a lot. There\u2019s no substitute for hard work. If you don\u2019t have the time and inclination to do research, that\u2019s 100% okay too. Just buy an index and live your life. Don\u2019t gamble on stocks you aren\u2019t interested in learning about. Sometimes you will lose money, sometimes you will make money.   Even Amazon was down more than 80% at one point. All you can do is move forward. The market doesn\u2019t care about your cost basis. Just try to make smart, reasoned decisions and you\u2019ll be fine.

My europoor broker app (Revolut) only allows buying and selling of shares. I figured good, because at least I won't gamble my money away on retarded YOLO plays like those WSB autists.  Bought my first stock (HAS) on August 14 2020.  Tried boomervesting, owning 69.4209001 diversified ass shares. After 1.5 months, made $5 profit on a $1000 investment. Fuck that shit.

Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.  Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.   Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.

            "Last Year a lady hit the back of my car and totalled my car. The check that I received from her insurance company I decided to finally invest. A friend told me about Robinhood so I went and bought a google share and other vanguard for dividends. 1-2 months later, I installed reddit and joined r/stocks and investings and found out about r/wallstreetbets. This is where it became interesting. I would see peoples post of 700% gains, 2,000% gains. And I got so excited! So Without knowing anything about options, I bought my first Spy Call expiring in a week. That was when Covid happened and stock crashed. After I bought spy puts, it went back up and I started being happy. Bought RCL puts. Was happy my money was recovering. And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it. And lost it all recently buying PLTR Calls and it crashed. Anyways. Thats my story. Just had to vent and get it off my chest, its been bothering me for a really long time for being this autistic. Love you guys! Let me know if you have any question."

Started reinvesting in some stocks I liked when a friend put me onto WSB. Saw the crazy gains and went spy calls for ez money. Doubled my 29k to 58k. Then June happened and my spy calls got fucked. Lost 18k. Pulled my money out and stopped trading for like a month or two. I was still up but I was also pretty devastated. Realized it\u2019s not easy money and I needed to be smarter. I eventually bought back into just stocks and started buying leaps. Sitting at 75k right now. I don\u2019t have the crazy gains that you see here but I also don\u2019t have the crazy losses either.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

Then I started swing trading by buying signals but it turns out they were absolutely moronic as well .  Then after blowing accounts a few times, I started learning about price action and technical pattern analysis and been trading with those techniques. But my account was blown again this November. Haha so much fun Now I\u2019m gonna follow my heart and throw my money on something I find here on wsb. Let\u2019s see if it makes me money or I loose some. Haha I dunno, I\u2019m like pretty bummed out with trading altogether because no matter how many techniques I learn, things go wrong a lotta time. Haha, I\u2019m gonna yolo my way to riches. Wish me luck ya retards",

            "I'm 20, had a lot of financial classes this academic year so I finally decided having a savings account is retarded and I need to invest. So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months. Can't wait to see what 2021 will bring, definitely holding everything right now (diamond hand gang).",

            "36 y/o teacher looking to get rich since I\u2019ve plateaued income-wise. I started in early 2018 when I saw you motherfuckers talking about yachts. When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

I know it\u2019s mostly all out of financial ignorance so I don\u2019t ever say anything but even still, the amount of hate people have for wealthy people is astounding.   I\u2019m not rich. I could definitely use 2k vs 600 in stimulus. But never in my fucking life would I try to advocate murdering bezos or whoever the meme hates this week. Like, it embarrasses me to watch another human so shamelessly display such intense jealousy for what another human has built.  To me, that sort of thinking just exemplifies the type of life a person like this lives\u2014bitching in the dark with their hand out, trying to take from someone else instead of using their success as an example for building their own. It\u2019s just super pathetic and cringy IMO. Like in high school when the ugly bitches don\u2019t like the hot girl for no other reason than she is hot and the boys like her.   That\u2019s why WSB is great. We all know that we could be rich, but it\u2019s our own fault that we aren\u2019t.

            "I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the female members of this group. The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend. Hopefully this clears a few things up with the more disgruntled members of the group.",

My father was a plumber by trade, flatulist by hoppy...made sense considering the smells he had to whiff in his line of work. Taught me how to control my gas from an early age, and I supplement this control with a ghstly diet. Find it's a good way of putting people in their place.....   Anyway I'm at Big Five near Los Angeles, CA... The pandemic is getting really bad here and the gov is about to bang up everybody in their homes....while I'm minding my own business trying to buy a gun and not spread the plague a man walks in....no mask on.   The scrawny kid up front tells John Wayne he'll need to wear a mask. \"Really?\" asks the duke incredulously as he sashays over to the fishing section.   Scrawny clearly doesn't know how to handle him but I do. I was locked and loaded, with a gut full of bananas dipped in salsa, milk, and Bush's pinto beans...my stomach was a scud missile and the duke was lookin like a saudi base.   I strolled over to John as he drooled over a fishing rod. We were back to back but I could see his reflection in my glasses. I waited patiently for my quarry to turn around. As soon I saw his floppy mug I let loose.   For about two seconds a sound somewhere between a shotgun blast and a hog revving roared through the store.   I spun around in case Marion tried to sucker punch me...to me relief I didn't feel any stool in my man panties. He looked shocked and angry, like a haughty cat sprayed with water.   We locked eyes like a couple of rams about to duel, and then the gas wafted up to his face. His lips warped into a terrible rictus and he turned tail...I think he said \"Jesus Christ\" as he scampered off.   He hopped in his plush F-150 and sped away never to return to Big Five... Didn't want to wear a mask to stop a virus...couldn't handle a little ass blast. Real tough guy.",

They also have positive earnings catalysts for q1...vaccine, pent up demand for elective surgery and a lower dollar for jnj....lower dollar, stimulus,and reopening story for coke....rgnx is a good small cap growth stock to have to complement my dividend plays.. it is also in a lot of popular etfs and i just believe biotech is going to be really strong going into next year.

Tilray and apha are leaders in the EU with facilities, licences, distribution (CC Pharma), and contracts.   The states is definitly the crown jewel of cannabis currently, but I predict that by 2025 Europe will have a drasticly matured medical side. Aphria and tilray have EU GMP certified facilities and first mover advantage. The international play is a long game though.     I want to see them get into the states as soon as they are legally able to. The thing with the states though is there is already alot of competition and licences are getting very expensive to acquire.

A typical good retard take would be that they are addicted to the rocket euphoria and don't want it to stop, I mean who wouldn't be? But the truth is flatlines is when people may start leaving, see AMD past few months and how much people want to fucking leave AMZN.   Speed of the short covering will heavily determine whether EOY stays at 20-22 or rockets to the fucking moon, because that's where all the useless FOMO mother fuckers will buy in.  If the squeeze keeps getting delayed, paper hands and your typical bitch tits will get manipulated and leave at small profit. The only way it gets rocket to the fucking moon by EOY without the short squeeze happening, is if Cohen announcing that he upped his stocks even more. Other paths to the moon without a short squeeze would be Q4 earnings report or announcement of ecommerce platform(or concretely working on it)",
            "I am a PLTR long-long but your thesis is weak.  Tendietards don't have the same capital management considerations that Buffett does; one of his major ones being direct return of cash to shareholders. He's a dividend investor, when he isn't buying businesses whole that generate surplus cash.   When Buffett/BRK started getting into KO, it was 1) one of the best brands on earth 2) growing worldwide 3) throwing off a div 4) Somewhat beaten down in price relative to the gleam of its actual business perspective after the Cola Wars and the \"New Coke\" disaster of the 1980s; an AMAZING choice to park large wads of cash for both direct return and potential growth upside. His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE? HOLDING STONKS FOR A LONG TIME CAN MAKE MONEY!\"",

I was a baby, so I'd lie if I said I remember anything from firsthand experience other than some fuzzy memories about running from the warzones, but I'm a direct descendant of 2 families that got killed, tortured and oppressed by the marxist ideology, systemically, for decades.  And if you think I'm some right wing nutcase, guess again. I hate fascism at least as equally, because that shit DIRECTLY CAUSED those 50 years of murderous communism in my homeland, on top of a mass genocide of Jews and other 'undesirables', sale of my region to Italy and overall psychotic ideology that was the catalyst for WW2.  I'm a member of a minuscule minority of population who has a drop of sane thought left in their brains in my country. A lot of my peers are radicalized, by left and right wing toxic ideologies. It's psychotic at times. I can't have 2 of my best friends in the same room because they fucking hate each other, because of some fuckwad ideologies from 1945.  I see this same shit being rolled out in North America, right now, under your very noses. Yet you don't see it, because they've perfected their methods and their craft, insidious and elegant, yet evil as fuck at its core.  Divide et impera. Being done right in the open, yet everybody cheers it as hating your neighbor is gonna fix your life's problems.  Good luck and, if you've got the rest of your life ahead of you, start thinking about your exit strategy, moving to another country, before it's too late for any of us maybe...",

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone.

            "I'm 20, had a lot of financial classes this academic year so I finally decided having a savings account is retarded and I need to invest. So i started out late October this year with a test portfolio of only 750 euros. Mostly bought European stock and two ETFs (NASDAQ &amp; EM). Due to vaccine news I made 250 in less than a month.  At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side). After one month I'm up approximately 700 on that portfolio, so overall I've made almost 1k in unrealised gains in a couple of months. Can't wait to see what 2021 will bring, definitely holding everything right now (diamond hand gang).",

            "36 y/o teacher looking to get rich since I\u2019ve plateaued income-wise. I started in early 2018 when I saw you motherfuckers talking about yachts. When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies.   I\u2019ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I\u2019d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I\u2019ve had my eye on.   Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever.   I\u2019ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I\u2019m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into \u2018timing the market\u2019 and ignoring \u2018time in the market\u2019 (that\u2019s what the retirement funds are for)  Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again.   I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I\u2019m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further.   I\u2019ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I\u2019m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I\u2019ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I\u2019m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.  MU - you were my first and I\u2019ll always remember you  AMD - you\u2019re cool  Various weed stocks - get your shit together  MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment   SPY - I know you\u2019re out to get me, but I\u2019ll keep coming back  DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs  RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap  PLTR - We\u2019ve just begun",
            "I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.  Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.  80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.  Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares",

I could definitely use 2k vs 600 in stimulus. But never in my fucking life would I try to advocate murdering bezos or whoever the meme hates this week. Like, it embarrasses me to watch another human so shamelessly display such intense jealousy for what another human has built.  To me, that sort of thinking just exemplifies the type of life a person like this lives\u2014bitching in the dark with their hand out, trying to take from someone else instead of using their success as an example for building their own. It\u2019s just super pathetic and cringy IMO. Like in high school when the ugly bitches don\u2019t like the hot girl for no other reason than she is hot and the boys like her.   That\u2019s why WSB is great. We all know that we could be rich, but it\u2019s our own fault that we aren\u2019t.

            "I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the female members of this group. The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend. Hopefully this clears a few things up with the more disgruntled members of the group.",

My father was a plumber by trade, flatulist by hoppy...made sense considering the smells he had to whiff in his line of work. Taught me how to control my gas from an early age, and I supplement this control with a ghstly diet. Find it's a good way of putting people in their place.....   Anyway I'm at Big Five near Los Angeles, CA... The pandemic is getting really bad here and the gov is about to bang up everybody in their homes....while I'm minding my own business trying to buy a gun and not spread the plague a man walks in....no mask on.   The scrawny kid up front tells John Wayne he'll need to wear a mask. \"Really?\" asks the duke incredulously as he sashays over to the fishing section.   Scrawny clearly doesn't know how to handle him but I do. I was locked and loaded, with a gut full of bananas dipped in salsa, milk, and Bush's pinto beans...my stomach was a scud missile and the duke was lookin like a saudi base.   I strolled over to John as he drooled over a fishing rod. We were back to back but I could see his reflection in my glasses. I waited patiently for my quarry to turn around. As soon I saw his floppy mug I let loose.   For about two seconds a sound somewhere between a shotgun blast and a hog revving roared through the store.   I spun around in case Marion tried to sucker punch me...to me relief I didn't feel any stool in my man panties. He looked shocked and angry, like a haughty cat sprayed with water.   We locked eyes like a couple of rams about to duel, and then the gas wafted up to his face. His lips warped into a terrible rictus and he turned tail...I think he said \"Jesus Christ\" as he scampered off.   He hopped in his plush F-150 and sped away never to return to Big Five... Didn't want to wear a mask to stop a virus...couldn't handle a little ass blast. Real tough guy.",

A typical good retard take would be that they are addicted to the rocket euphoria and don't want it to stop, I mean who wouldn't be? But the truth is flatlines is when people may start leaving, see AMD past few months and how much people want to fucking leave AMZN.   Speed of the short covering will heavily determine whether EOY stays at 20-22 or rockets to the fucking moon, because that's where all the useless FOMO mother fuckers will buy in.  If the squeeze keeps getting delayed, paper hands and your typical bitch tits will get manipulated and leave at small profit. The only way it gets rocket to the fucking moon by EOY without the short squeeze happening, is if Cohen announcing that he upped his stocks even more. Other paths to the moon without a short squeeze would be Q4 earnings report or announcement of ecommerce platform(or concretely working on it)",
            "I am a PLTR long-long but your thesis is weak.  Tendietards don't have the same capital management considerations that Buffett does; one of his major ones being direct return of cash to shareholders. He's a dividend investor, when he isn't buying businesses whole that generate surplus cash.   When Buffett/BRK started getting into KO, it was 1) one of the best brands on earth 2) growing worldwide 3) throwing off a div 4) Somewhat beaten down in price relative to the gleam of its actual business perspective after the Cola Wars and the \"New Coke\" disaster of the 1980s; an AMAZING choice to park large wads of cash for both direct return and potential growth upside. His super risk-averse thesis (which all goes back to compounding over time and capital loss being the absolute worst case scenario) favors certain business dynamics, like KO. Obviously, a smart decision.   The PLTR thesis is that eventually, what they do will become intertwined with (everything) and that's true, but their moat exists pretty much around their secret-squirrel stuff. They \\*WILL\\* eventually face stiff competition in their general data science products, which will impact margins and eventually, profit (and profit potential). As an old-beard who remembers how the 1990s unfolded and the internet (and what not), this is not a new story. The shockingly innovative golden children fall quite mightily when something even better comes along.   For radical growth over time in a tech company, the secret sauce seems to be 1) growth into 'everything' 2) standardization in the most lucrative verticals (consumer and business and government) 3) shareholder enthusiasm to accept weird valuation multiples, absent a dividend. PLTR has some of #1, some of #2 and a lot of #3.   PLTR ticks some good boxes but KO stock in the 1980s was a straight value play for no reason other than they were growing rapidly worldwide around that time and some meaningful percentage of all fluids consumed by humans on planet earth was/is a KO product. PLTR won't ever achieve that kind of ubiquity, but it could achieve an absurd share price.  tl;dr- KO and PLTR aren't a valid comparison unless the whole point is \"SEE? SEE? HOLDING STONKS FOR A LONG TIME CAN MAKE MONEY!\"",

BTW, $20 ended up being a massive limit buy price, a lot of longs piled in, the price briefly dipped below and then just strong bounce back into the $20.05-$20.15 territory.

None of it was his work.  Everytime something bad happens, it becomes apparent they were lying about everything. When their deal with GM started to unravel, we all got to see that they needed GM to not only produce the Badger, but provide all the battery and engine technology because they didn't have any. When the garbage truck deal fell through, it is again apparent that they lied about their capabilities. There are other companies already making electric garbage trucks, so it's not like it's some impossible dream. Nikola just isn't capable of it.

Citron has a tiny bit more accountability to not just be huge pumpers, because there's an easy trail for the SEC if necessary.  But yeah, Citron literally buys or shorts the names they analyze, so their analysis has to be taken with a grain of salt. That's very different from equity research when firms like Goldman issue a price target on, say, Tesla, because then, that analyst doesn't touch Tesla stock, they're paid to research it, not to own it.",

I expect the streaming news will be significant and it will drive the stock higher. My comparison is to the 2019 investor day when we first got a real picture of the Disney streaming story. My trade is in part based on expectations being much lower than Disney and they over delivering in a big way. I think the upside could be greater than a 10-15% move post investor day. Also betting on a run up to investor day as we get more info but I like how they are doing new Star Trek and building on the franchises they own. I see the streaming wars going 1 DIS 2 VIAC and that\u2019s a big part of the trade the street will just realize this on or even a few days after investor day 2021.",

            "As paramount plus rolls out next year I think youll see a difference in some of those issues but Netflix overall is a very expensive streaming play to invest in and they will still use a large portion of ViacomCBS content in the catalog. They aren\u2019t compete with Netflix as much as compete against HBO Max Peacock and the smaller services, Netflix has a different product that\u2019s more broad than anyone else. Showtime will compete against HBO which has a lack of leadership. Disney is competing more with their bundle against Netflix at a high price point. the SVOD business is wide open and I\u2019m even more bullish on Fast and Showtime. We don\u2019t have enough info on Paramount Plus 2 year slate which is the entire reason there is outsized upside on the trade. It\u2019s a show me now story.

            "I think it could go to 40$ easily by early 2021 abd possibly higher over next year depending on paramount plus launch is received. They have a lot of content In production, like Disney we don\u2019t know what and I expect a lot of the news will be about the future content and international expansion. They saw the Disney play book and have time to refine some of their decisions to be more in line with franchise development and value creation for shareholders. I am very bullish on the future for VIAC",
            "Viacom owns so much shit its ridiculous. Just as ridiculous as all the shit Disney owns. One thing, Disney investor day saw a 10%+ growth last year and this year it was 12%. A more established pattern if you will. Does Viacom have the same history with their investor day?",
            "Not really given they are a newly merged company A lot of the high growth assets are either new IE Pluto or new for major growth shifts IE showtime and CBS. I expect the streaming news will be significant and it will drive the stock higher. My comparison is to the 2019 investor day when we first got a real picture of the Disney streaming story. My trade is in part based on expectations being much lower than Disney and they over delivering in a big way. I think the upside could be greater than a 10-15% move post investor day. Also betting on a run up to investor day as we get more info but I like how they are doing new Star Trek and building on the franchises they own. I see the streaming wars going 1 DIS 2 VIAC and that\u2019s a big part of the trade the street will just realize this on or even a few days after investor day 2021.",
            "As paramount plus rolls out next year I think youll see a difference in some of those issues but Netflix overall is a very expensive streaming play to invest in and they will still use a large portion of ViacomCBS content in the catalog. They aren\u2019t compete with Netflix as much as compete against HBO Max Peacock and the smaller services, Netflix has a different product that\u2019s more broad than anyone else. Showtime will compete against HBO which has a lack of leadership. Disney is competing more with their bundle against Netflix at a high price point. the SVOD business is wide open and I\u2019m even more bullish on Fast and Showtime. We don\u2019t have enough info on Paramount Plus 2 year slate which is the entire reason there is outsized upside on the trade. It\u2019s a show me now story. So once you see the slate you can make up your mind. I\u2019ve seen enough and know where I\u2019m placing bets."

Stumbled upon this site in December from r/conspiracy as The Big Short was one of my favorite movies and over there we knew how fucked rona was gonna be before mainstream got a hold of it.

I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone.

Dumb strategy but was up 30% when I stopped and bought a mutual fund...the fund lost 50% in a year. I dabbled in a few stocks here and there for a while but was broke bagging groceries for a living with a 4 year degree.  Got a job in finance in 2011, bought some individual stocks that were still undervalued here and there. Tried letting a firm manage the money but it cost too much for the value. Now I use a Vanguard ETFs but place 1-3% total portfolio value bets on individual stocks and let them run. Used FAANG for a while with solid returns. Doubled my money on Roku way back...should not have sold it at 60. In the last 5 years I'm up 125% vs sp500 96%. Only 345% Tesla gains from 10 shares.  I'm not permitted to trade options but got lucky and bought 200 shares of PLTR at $9.54 right before I started paying attention to this sub.

Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.

Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week.

I convince him to purchase some Tesla shares pre split, at the moment those shares have doubled. I also predicted that other EV stocks such as XPEV will also blow up due to Tesla. Also prompted him on PLTR when they listed back in September. After seeing all these stocks go up I urgently needed to get my own trading account.

I was holding NVDA at the time and some other stocks but NVDA took most of my money since i sold at a loss fearing i was never going to make my money back. Sometime in 2019 I was unemployed and started trading shares again. This time making minimal profits. Some $30 or $15. Very minuscule profits but it paid for my weed and gas. Fast forward to 2020, I jumped back into trading after a few months of having my account collect dust because I learned about options trading. Saw a few videos on youtube and said fuck it why not. Dont really know what all this gamma, vega, delta bullshit is but here goes nothing. And so far its been going better than i expected it to be.

I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with.

At the beginning of this month, I put all my remaining savings (around 7.5k on top of the earlier 750) into stock and ETFs. This time I bought meme stock (TSLA, NIO, LGVW, PLTR, GME, APHA) and a couple others, plus I put my ETF money into more agressive ones (WTAI, ESPO, ICLN) and then a chunk into IWDA for world exposure (my boomer side).

That would also make it much less violent, and the price probably can't go super-parabolic, but it will definitely help push it a bit higher than it would be without this massive short accumulation.",
            "Nah dude, the MOASS is still, like, a 5% likely to happen kind of event. Too many variables and uncertainty at play for this thing to reach boiling point that easily. A month ago, when I first invested in GME, the whole uber-squeeze scenario did not make sense to me. The big players like Melvin Capital and BofA do not just let themselves get fucked over easily like that, they've got loads of ways, connections and ammo to bid their time and exit at breakeven or even minor profit.  What is quite likely, is this TSLA scenario, where we slowly burn up and up for weeks and months next year, as long as a constant stream of new positive catalysts hits the news every few days and the overall sentiment keeps slowly, but surely shifting from \"HAR HAR Blockbuster bankruptcy\" to \"well I'll be damned, they're actually turning this around...\"  Then, we might hit those $60+ price targets, which, even now, for most people would be a 3x at least.",

            "If I want a $65k position in TSLA, and I buy shares alone, I'd have 100 and therefore a 100 delta. But I want more risk and reward, so I sell 40 of those shares and buy a Sept $420c that has a 86 delta. Now I have 60 shares and the leaps for a total delta of 146. 1.46 times what I'd have with shares alone. Plus I can sell an occasional FD (guess I could have with 100 shares too, but I don't like all my long assets tied up in case things go wrong).  TSLA is a bit more difficult because it's expensive. Right now I'm leveraged on MSFT about 4x the delta if have with shares alone. $25k position could buy about 113 shares, or a 113 delta. I think I have June leaps right now that total up to about a 500 delta. IV has been low, so I leveraged up just in time.  Merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84",

Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app.   Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that.   I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.  I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).  I have about $106k left in my RH account.

With the setup we have, a slow gradual decrease of short interest, which has already been happening lately, followed by a slow gradual increase in price seems like the most likely way this short squeeze is going to effectively play out. That would also make it much less violent, and the price probably can't go super-parabolic, but it will definitely help push it a bit higher than it would be without this massive short accumulation.",

The big players like Melvin Capital and BofA do not just let themselves get fucked over easily like that, they've got loads of ways, connections and ammo to bid their time and exit at breakeven or even minor profit.  What is quite likely, is this TSLA scenario, where we slowly burn up and up for weeks and months next year, as long as a constant stream of new positive catalysts hits the news every few days and the overall sentiment keeps slowly, but surely shifting from \"HAR HAR Blockbuster bankruptcy\" to \"well I'll be damned, they're actually turning this around...\"  Then, we might hit those $60+ price targets, which, even now, for most people would be a 3x at least.",

Plus I can sell an occasional FD (guess I could have with 100 shares too, but I don't like all my long assets tied up in case things go wrong).  TSLA is a bit more difficult because it's expensive. Right now I'm leveraged on MSFT about 4x the delta if have with shares alone. $25k position could buy about 113 shares, or a 113 delta.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",
            "I saw the coronavirus impacts coming in Feb but my account manager kept talking me out of going cash. This continued until about 2/3 of the way toward the bottom in March when I put my foot down and transferred my account to TD Ameritrade. I stayed cash until April, in part listening to bears on WSB and Twitter. I started trying to understand options, and then seeing the recovery was underway in April, I started trading options to try to catch up. I had 126k at that point. I was also unemployed and living with a relative, going to school part time looking to switch careers. I quickly saw some success of a few k, which seemed like a big deal, then obviously made some bad trades and was rather depressed. My goal at that point was to make back my money and quit. At my lowest I had 80k, I just couldn't even look at my account for a few days while the market gyrated ahead of LOW and HD earnings. Considering my living situation/unemployment, it was a lot of stress. But I kept at it because honestly what choice did I have, and I reminded myself that I had some right to be doing this because at least I saw CV19 coming when Wall St was asleep.   With calls on HD and LOW I managed to fight back above 100k, then fluctuated between 100 and the 100-teens. Was starting to get the hang of it, finding DD methods and an investing thesis that worked (using google trends to find companies surviving or benefitting from the COVID spend shift, also watching unusual options activity). The June 5 gap up, along with a successful AEO earnings play, brought me to 150k almost overnight. Of course I didn't sell, but rather bought hella calls, and rode my acct back down to the 120s-130s with the 6/10 selloff.   However my DD methods, and my background in biotech, saved me. I bought calls on WKHS when it was &lt;$5 by scanning UOA, and I bought calls on Inovio because I knew their tech was legit. My INO calls were way underwater in part because of Citron Research but I diamond-handed them because Andrew Left is a clown. INO and WKHS broke out at the same time, in late June, when the market was selling off, and all of a sudden I had 270k in my account and a dip to buy. That was my big break. I honed my DD methods and trades, focusing on what worked, and over the course of July and August I actually 9x'd my account from the starting balance.  Yes, on Sept 1 and 2 I was a millionaire. But I was also pretty much clinically depressed, stressed out from trading daily for months, crappy living situation, knowing my longterm unemployment probably meant I couldn't find work in my field again, etc.   I knew VIX was up with SPY meaning a selloff was imminent. But I felt like time was running out on my investing thesis. I still felt like I had no real idea what I was doing, and I might never be able to make money like this again, so I stayed levered up. On Sept 3rd, I had 4 earnings plays. Broke my rules on investing what I didn't know (software) on one, that was Weds night (PD). Other 3 - MIK, TTC and SIG- all sold off the next day despite great earnings. The Covid spend shift market was over, and the sell-the-news, economic/election-uncertainty market had begun. I panic sold my calls for a loss of 270k, although by the next day my TTC and SIG calls would have put me nearer to breakeven on the week. This kinda put me in a tailspin.  I kept doing worse trades- listened to someone's recommendation to catch the knife on AAPL in the midst of its selloff to 90s, playing earnings that the market wasn't interested in any more, playing INO but getting screwed by the FDA, sizing huge, losing huge, rinse, repeat. One final trade I entered into after listening to a hedge funder blew one more hole in my acct, and by the end of October I was back where I started- 127k. Went cash, felt miserable. After the election, I started looking for trades again. This time, I was disciplined about trade selection, size, and entries/exits, etc. Found some new angles on the market, learned some new DD methods, took my account to 270k. Whew. I started paying closer attention to a trading room, that I had long been subscribed to but had previously ignored (yes, its legit; no its not one of those ones that spam Twitter. They provide real-time entries and exits, discussion, etc.) Currently sitting at 563k.   I still make bad trades. In fact, as I type this I am sized too large in one particular trade, but my acct is at the size where I am kinda ok if it goes wrong. I'm not going to chase my losses like I did in September. I have a better support/research group in the trading room (WSB is actually pretty bad for this and can be a very toxic place). I've proven I can make money in two very different market regimes.

            "$20 is the clear support here, downward momentum got rejected hard today at that price, multiple times, just like the upward momentum got rejected at 22 yesterday, also multiple times. Sideways movement seems most likely for the next week, unless Daddy Cohen graces us with another \"over 9000\" 13D meme.  Bearish sentiment is slowly waning, and their hit pieces like that Motley Tool article earlier today and that retarded Shilling Alpha short thesis yesterday are edging on self-parody at this point.  A lot of non-WSB investing community is already woke on GME bull thesis, sounding off in the comments of afforementioned articles. Twitter is frenzied about GME too, following Hedgeye's bullish $50 target. Word is out and spreading fast.  With all this in mind, my fully amateur, incompetent, retard prediction is more of the same - opening hour bullishness resulting in big initial price spike/gap up, followed by meek/slow mid-day movement and small dips and rallies by the end of the day for the overall sideways trading pattern. We've rallied hard and fast this week, stonk has to cooldown a bit.  Lowest point is probably $19 Highest is 23, 22 wall is strong and thick and there's another one at 24 behind it, a lot of buys happened during the September q2 earnings dip into the $6 range, a lot of those longs will be exiting at 4x for sure.

            "$20 is the clear support here, downward momentum got rejected hard today at that price, multiple times, just like the upward momentum got rejected at 22 yesterday, also multiple times. Sideways movement seems most likely for the next week, unless Daddy Cohen graces us with another \"over 9000\" 13D meme.  Bearish sentiment is slowly waning, and their hit pieces like that Motley Tool article earlier today and that retarded Shilling Alpha short thesis yesterday are edging on self-parody at this point.  A lot of non-WSB investing community is already woke on GME bull thesis, sounding off in the comments of afforementioned articles. Twitter is frenzied about GME too, following Hedgeye's bullish $50 target. Word is out and spreading fast.  With all this in mind, my fully amateur, incompetent, retard prediction is more of the same - opening hour bullishness resulting in big initial price spike/gap up, followed by meek/slow mid-day movement and small dips and rallies by the end of the day for the overall sideways trading pattern. We've rallied hard and fast this week, stonk has to cooldown a bit.  Lowest point is probably $19 Highest is 23, 22 wall is strong and thick and there's another one at 24 behind it, a lot of buys happened during the September q2 earnings dip into the $6 range, a lot of those longs will be exiting at 4x for sure.

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics."

This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics."

I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver.

            "I started trading (as an on-the-side thing, I\u2019ve always had a full-time job) in 2016. I probably was pretty much flat from 2016 to this year. I tried a bunch of different things and strategies, etc. and I\u2019d go up a bunch then down a bunch and over three years probably was just even.  I started making a lot more in salary though and this year really put a lot in my brokerage and found that the secret to making money in the market is having money. This year I\u2019ve done really well and it\u2019s because I have set goals, abide by them, and if something goes sideways, I don\u2019t stress because no one trade makes up too much of my account.  Three years ago because I had less, I would dedicate too much to just a few trades and if the market turned I was stuck. I didn\u2019t want to sell at huge losses but I also then didn\u2019t have any money to trade with. That led to a lot of stress and emotional (and therefore bad) decisions.  Now if something goes against me, I can just let it sit until it recovers and go about my business. I can stay calm and make rational decisions instead of desperate decisions, and that (plus a crazy bull market...) has made all the difference.",

            "Well I obviously started in things I thought would grow in the future/tech , Tesla, amd, nvidia. But the real break came when I heard about DraftKings going public through a SPAC merger. Had no idea what that even was but it allowed me to start making bigger bets and It was the company that got me into options, which obviously are the biggest part of my gains. I had known about DraftKings for years and thought it was an absolute beast of a company. Full ATM machine/ print money at will. Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early. Picked some catalyst dates and picked a spread of options with varying risk)My latest and biggest gainer is Gme. I got in June and July at 4$ and just loved all the catalysts that would come for them in the fall with console cycle. Nothing I\u2019ve put money in has come from wsb. It\u2019s definitely important to do your own research/ have a plan/ and believe in what you\u2019re investing in. It\u2019s helped me hold through tough times.",

Waiting a while, slapped $80 in there, got a peak of $1300 annnd it\u2019s gone, back down to a little over $80, invested $650 more so now I have $730 my own cash(740ish in my portfolio) cranked that bitch up to $1900 in less than a week anddd today I ended at $680 what a cunt.

Articles about RH and WSB piqued my interest. Made a deposit 10/1 and am 4x now. PLTR and various ARK related picks to thank.

            "2016, started to get interested in stocks and had my boomer of a dad put some money into Chevron and Ford. Ford never really panned out, but Chevron did and I/we sold around $30 profit/share. When I turned 18 is when I hopped on robinhood, made some gains here and there buying low and selling high on some small company stocks.   I was in Engineering in college but then decided it wasn\u2019t my thing, switched to a Supply Chain major which involved taking a shitload of Accounting, Finance, Management, and etc type classes where I learned a bit about Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Risk Management. Made a rookie move back in March and sold as soon as I heard COVID was coming, didn\u2019t buy back in either (I was holding Tesla and Apple, for some reason turned bearish). Learned my lesson from that. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research/analysis and picking options without putting any actual money in them because losing a few hundred is devastating to a college student and I\u2019m not as ballsy as some of you fuckers.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

            "I discovered wallstreetbets back during the ironyman saga. I didn't know what was happening and wsb sure as hell wasn't going to tell me, so I did some reading and learned about options. Put $500 in a RH account and promptly lost all but $150 on shitty otm calls. I was intrigued at that point, though, so I did some more reading, discovered spreads, and traded $150 up to $2k. Then the corona crash and subsequent recovery happened and I wiped my account as I failed to acknowledge the trend in both cases. At that point I decided directional trading was not for me--it was stressful as fuck and discussing me from my job, but at the same time I just couldn't leave it all bring now knowing about what you could do with options. Did some more reading, learned about theta strategies. Since then I've been running a directionally neutral theta strategy (not on RH obviously) that I have revised 3-4 times, and I'm finally making consistent gains and sleeping well at the same time. But it took a ton of research. I still spend time trying to learn more and analyzing past performance in order to slowly get better. And every step where I learn something new and improved my trading is incredibly gratifying. It's been a ton of fun from the start",
            "Played around with some calls and puts In my freshman year of college where I lost about 2K. Then after that during my junior year I decided to try up options again in March when everything was just starting to go down. I later learned about wsb, and followed the train where I would yolo spy puts daily for free tendies (Man I miss those -10% days). Anyway I turned 300$ into 15K in the span of a month and thought I was some kind of god. Well I guess I was a bit too gay and kept betting against America even when the trend reversed and lost it all. I took a break to focus on my studies and still lurk but recently I have more cash and came back with the lesson I learned regarding the trend is your friend and stocks only go up lol",

I immediately thought how easy this was and planned my future as a multi millionaire. more and more news of shutdowns and quarantine were flooding the media and i thought there's no way lyft was a sustainable business during these hard times so i used logic and bought more puts. of course it ran up like 10% the next day and my puts lost like 80% of its value. well long story short those losses were some important lessons and to this day ive made around 200k and day trade 50k~ worth of options with my daily goal to make 5-10% a day.",

I pussied out of every good play I had and did nothing until early august. Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.   Well, it\u2019s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD\u2019s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week. But never believed in my plays that ran no matter how many times I was proved right.   Throughout the month of august until now I have bought nothing and I\u2019m down to my last $700 cause bills raping me, everyday I tell myself I\u2019ll buy, I\u2019ll trust my gut, and fight with myself etc, and nothing changes.

I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays.

The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

The big players like Melvin Capital and BofA do not just let themselves get fucked over easily like that, they've got loads of ways, connections and ammo to bid their time and exit at breakeven or even minor profit.  What is quite likely, is this TSLA scenario, where we slowly burn up and up for weeks and months next year, as long as a constant stream of new positive catalysts hits the news every few days and the overall sentiment keeps slowly, but surely shifting from \"HAR HAR Blockbuster bankruptcy\" to \"well I'll be damned, they're actually turning this around...\"  Then, we might hit those $60+ price targets, which, even now, for most people would be a 3x at least.",

North America is basically doomed at this point, your leaders have sold you all out and I give it 50 years tops in the best case scenario, before it becomes nothing but a Chinese proxy.  No politician or any 'system figurehead', as I like to call them (think Bill Gates and co.) is selfless, they're self-serving, most of them pricks, a few of them with a smidge of moral compass, but as a whole, they're there to ensure the \"plebs\" are in line, one way or another.  I'm speaking this from a perspective of a dude that was born during a communist regime fallout. I was a baby, so I'd lie if I said I remember anything from firsthand experience other than some fuzzy memories about running from the warzones, but I'm a direct descendant of 2 families that got killed, tortured and oppressed by the marxist ideology, systemically, for decades.  And if you think I'm some right wing nutcase, guess again. I hate fascism at least as equally, because that shit DIRECTLY CAUSED those 50 years of murderous communism in my homeland, on top of a mass genocide of Jews and other 'undesirables', sale of my region to Italy and overall psychotic ideology that was the catalyst for WW2.  I'm a member of a minuscule minority of population who has a drop of sane thought left in their brains in my country. A lot of my peers are radicalized, by left and right wing toxic ideologies. It's psychotic at times. I can't have 2 of my best friends in the same room because they fucking hate each other, because of some fuckwad ideologies from 1945.  I see this same shit being rolled out in North America, right now, under your very noses. Yet you don't see it, because they've perfected their methods and their craft, insidious and elegant, yet evil as fuck at its core.  Divide et impera. Being done right in the open, yet everybody cheers it as hating your neighbor is gonna fix your life's problems.

This year I\u2019ve done really well and it\u2019s because I have set goals, abide by them, and if something goes sideways, I don\u2019t stress because no one trade makes up too much of my account.  Three years ago because I had less, I would dedicate too much to just a few trades and if the market turned I was stuck. I didn\u2019t want to sell at huge losses but I also then didn\u2019t have any money to trade with. That led to a lot of stress and emotional (and therefore bad) decisions.  Now if something goes against me, I can just let it sit until it recovers and go about my business.

            "Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (&lt;$200 worth), which was a beginner \"mistake\", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE &amp; UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally &lt;$400 worth) while doing youtube \"research\" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the \"top\", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \\~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \\~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, as a treat, if you're still reading, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  \"@ReverseSplitArb\"",

            "I discovered wallstreetbets back during the ironyman saga. I didn't know what was happening and wsb sure as hell wasn't going to tell me, so I did some reading and learned about options. Put $500 in a RH account and promptly lost all but $150 on shitty otm calls. I was intrigued at that point, though, so I did some more reading, discovered spreads, and traded $150 up to $2k. Then the corona crash and subsequent recovery happened and I wiped my account as I failed to acknowledge the trend in both cases. At that point I decided directional trading was not for me--it was stressful as fuck and discussing me from my job, but at the same time I just couldn't leave it all bring now knowing about what you could do with options. Did some more reading, learned about theta strategies. Since then I've been running a directionally neutral theta strategy (not on RH obviously) that I have revised 3-4 times, and I'm finally making consistent gains and sleeping well at the same time. But it took a ton of research. I still spend time trying to learn more and analyzing past performance in order to slowly get better. And every step where I learn something new and improved my trading is incredibly gratifying. It's been a ton of fun from the start",
            "Played around with some calls and puts In my freshman year of college where I lost about 2K. Then after that during my junior year I decided to try up options again in March when everything was just starting to go down. I later learned about wsb, and followed the train where I would yolo spy puts daily for free tendies (Man I miss those -10% days). Anyway I turned 300$ into 15K in the span of a month and thought I was some kind of god. Well I guess I was a bit too gay and kept betting against America even when the trend reversed and lost it all. I took a break to focus on my studies and still lurk but recently I have more cash and came back with the lesson I learned regarding the trend is your friend and stocks only go up lol",
            "My last quarter of university around march when the market was falling I randomly saw some wsb gainz in r/all and immediately downloaded robinhood to try and learn options. my very first trade i made 100% gains on lyft puts and thought 100%+ gains were normal. I immediately thought how easy this was and planned my future as a multi millionaire. more and more news of shutdowns and quarantine were flooding the media and i thought there's no way lyft was a sustainable business during these hard times so i used logic and bought more puts. of course it ran up like 10% the next day and my puts lost like 80% of its value. well long story short those losses were some important lessons and to this day ive made around 200k and day trade 50k~ worth of options with my daily goal to make 5-10% a day.",
            "I have a lot of money in real estate and a lot of money in qqq and mutual funds and money in solid long term stocks too.  So it\u2019s nice those are alk doing well.   The Robinhood is just kind of play money I\u2019m trying to get rich with",
            "I was 19 and my told me about it in March and just ignored him, I did a little trading in June and stopped I was up $200. I came back in July and yolod my life savings (10.5k) in RH.   I pussied out of every good play I had and did nothing until early august. Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is.   Well, it\u2019s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD\u2019s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened.   No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week. But never believed in my plays that ran no matter how many times I was proved right.   Throughout the month of august until now I have bought nothing and I\u2019m down to my last $700 cause bills raping me, everyday I tell myself I\u2019ll buy, I\u2019ll trust my gut, and fight with myself etc, and nothing changes. My parents think I have my money still and I have not spoke to any friends in months. I never thought I\u2019d let myself get this far down everyday since July 24th I wake up at 7 and watch the market until close and have done nothing but not trust my gut and it\u2019s fucked me over.   And I\u2019m at my last leg of desperation, my dealer offered to buy my car back 15-18k and I\u2019m gonna sell it. Deposit all of it in RH, turn on margin and start trading. I will either dig myself out of this hole or lose it all and Kill myself, no exceptions.",

ThAt one phrase changed my entire perspective",
            "I started trading CFDs with IMacademy but it turned out their techniques didn\u2019t always give results. Sometimes very bad losses.  Then I started swing trading by buying signals but it turns out they were absolutely moronic as well .  Then after blowing accounts a few times, I started learning about price action and technical pattern analysis and been trading with those techniques. But my account was blown again this November. Haha so much fun Now I\u2019m gonna follow my heart and throw my money on something I find here on wsb. Let\u2019s see if it makes me money or I loose some. Haha I dunno, I\u2019m like pretty bummed out with trading altogether because no matter how many techniques I learn, things go wrong a lotta time. Haha, I\u2019m gonna yolo my way to riches. Wish me luck ya retards",
            "I started trading a few years ago when I graduated college. One of the first stocks I ever invested in (after a lot of DD) was TLRY on it's ipo. Figured it'd be a solid investment and sure had a lot of hype around it.   Well.. not sure if anyone's familiar with how that massive pump and dump went.. but I can still remember thinking how much of a genius I was for getting in at $22/share when it spiked above $200. Only to watch it go down about $100 in a single day. What a great introduction to how MM manipulate the fuck out of the market \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
            "I started in January 2019. I had my first job out of undergrad from late 2018 and had disposable income for the first time. I really got interested in stocks after starting my 401k and then I stumbled onto options and wsb. I bought spy calls and nio options and other weekly fds which did well before March to April where stonks went flat and I lost 3k after buying like dumb ass nio calls with no volume so there was literally no buyer for a week and a half as I watched it bleed to 0. I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip and tripled my money and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays. I joined theta gang and started the wheel. Now I am proud of my portfolio and occasionally yolo on stuff like gme, steel, or other spacs which is the new cool thing into tendies.",

            "I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the female members of this group. The accusations regarding my so called \"behavior\" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accusers (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: thinking  1) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.  2) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it.  3) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people  4) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a \"threat\". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.  5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called \"opinion\" no matter how misguided it may be.  As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend. Hopefully this clears a few things up with the more disgruntled members of the group.",

            "&gt; Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.   I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.  If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.  Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.  You know who \\*does\\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.  If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.  The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later?   Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \\*faster\\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.  There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.",

I was a bitc01n maximalist for much of the last 8 years, though I did get lucky with AMD because I thought crypt0 had an outstretched effect on the market (Sell the shovels, and all that), I still just bought larger tech stocks (with a few exceptions) that I thought were \"safe\" since my less safe money was already in a crazy vehicle, I didn't want to be 100% YOLO.   I don't know if I'll find my next bitc01n/AMD/Chipotle, but when I sold TSLA I thought \"wait, large cap stocks aren't supposed to go parabolic this much this fast, right?\", and I've been used to TSLA correcting heavily for much of the last 7 years and the naysayers being slow to catch on (Hopefully it still does because I'm a long term believer and want back in haha).   Elon still made me some good cash, but I settled on Model S money, when I could have had new house money. Oh well. My appetite for losing hundreds of thousands of dollars went out the window in 2017. I don't want to experience that again, and so I guess I'm OK with being called a boomer now, lol.",
            "I mean that \"euro is more than the dollar\" thing doesn't really work  The reason being: you're all buying stuff in Euros. A game is still $60 / 60 euro. Cars are 25k dollars / Euros  The exchange rate doesn't influence buying power  But that's not too bad for 19 as you say. Idk what kind of apprentice you are but here we have trade schools and you can finish those and be stuff like a mechanic, plumber, welder, etc. And those tend to pay pretty well.",

            "Could be hyln as well?",
            "I hope you guys make a fuck ton of money, but I just don\u2019t see how GameStop is going to be able to resurrect itself as the one-stop-shop for gamers online. It already has a bad reputation amongst the nerd crowd, and it\u2019s well known they sort of didn\u2019t treat their employees very well. Just doesn\u2019t seem like a logical investment to me. But like I said... I hope to see you all on the moon.",
            "I\u2019m curious as well.",
            "Well done. Whats that logo middle right?",
            "There is an implicit fallacy in the phrase \"to the moon\". Like the sun the moon rises as well as falls. At least from our earthly perspective.",
            "LOL.  That is counting my margin. :/  Owe  $144,000 on margin with Uncle Schwab.  VLDR isn't marginable and have 34k in it right now :/  I think some of my OTC stocks aren't marginable as well.  Got a couple of boomer stocks that will be getting assigned today unless the market \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15 today.  I will throw some money at GME calls next week when I harvest the last of my tax losses and then after the first of the year when I realize some gains.  I am tapped out. Come on Santa rally, need some GME calls. \ud83c\udf85\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15",

            "That's just one venue. There are plenty others, some barely covered by competition, where they can expand and grow.  It's all about incentives for customers, and Cohen seems to understand incentivization very, very well. That's why #WeWantCohen",
            "Yeah, those are my thoughts as well. Between Steam, Origin, Epic, Stadia, Google and AWS versions of Stadia, Parcer... I'm not sure what is unique about GameStop's position besides being supported Ryan Cohen.  Time will tell. But replicating Chewy for physical gaming products seems to be a pretty weak vision. We already have subscription gaming bundles like Humble Bundle or whatever Microsoft is doing for Xbox. Having a lot of stores is not exactly a \"wide moat.\"  I'm also concerned with what happens around January expiration dates when all of WSB starts unloading their ITM contracts. This whole GME situation is a fascinating powderkeg and I definitely want to watch when it goes off haha.",
