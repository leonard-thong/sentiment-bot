            "&gt; GME is a financially healthy company  How do you figure? They haven\u2019t turned a profit since 2017 and have had steadily declining revenues every year for the last decade.

The balance sheet is a disaster as well. Book equity is about half of what it was a year ago, and it\u2019s going to turn to negative equity if they have a 1-2 more years of operations similar to 2020.  I really don\u2019t understand how this dying brick and mortar dinosaur which absolutely will be extinct within 5 years has somehow has become the wsb meme de jour. I understand that it\u2019s a short squeeze play but that has nothing to do with the underlying fundamentals of the company\u2019s financials, which are a train wreck.

This is legal where I live, the tax man only cares about my bank account income statements for now. It could change in the future. I have microdick budget ($4.6k) and I didn't lie my way into Interactive Brokers or some other more reputable platform that want big dick $20k+ budget investors.  In your retard opinion, am I shooting myself in the foot too much for trying to postpone taxes eating away some of my current gains? In other words, is the downside of not having access to thousands of different stocks outweighing the upside of tax reporting flexibility?  For example, I couldn't do your STIC play, because there's no STIC in Revolut.   Thank you and [DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) for confirming my GME conviction btw. I was into this stock since August/September, before I was even active on this sub."

Kind of confused by your wording with \"timeline for paying taxes\", generally you get a lower tax burden for holding the positions for a year +1 day (capital gains tax rate) as opposed to less than a year (where you would just pay income tax). You can use up to $3k a year in losses to offset gains, anything over $3k can be carried forward until amount is exhausted.  2. Dont listen to WSB and you'll be fine. Understand basics of pricing and theta decay.  3. Apple will always be around and will always do well. If you want to try and use those gains for a more aggressive strategy then I'd say liquidate it (or at least partially) and play around with those giants. I'd say fuck around with the amount and see how much you can liquidate without killing yourself in taxes (since this has been held for long enough, will be either 15% or 20% depending on your tax bracket)",

            "&gt; GME is a financially healthy company  How do you figure? They haven\u2019t turned a profit since 2017 and have had steadily declining revenues every year for the last decade.

The balance sheet is a disaster as well. Book equity is about half of what it was a year ago, and it\u2019s going to turn to negative equity if they have a 1-2 more years of operations similar to 2020.  I really don\u2019t understand how this dying brick and mortar dinosaur which absolutely will be extinct within 5 years has somehow has become the wsb meme de jour. I understand that it\u2019s a short squeeze play but that has nothing to do with the underlying fundamentals of the company\u2019s financials, which are a train wreck.

So my advice to you is to take whatever you know and think, related to your 200 GME positions, evaluate all of that and then come up with an exit strategy.  For me personally, if the short squeeze gets squoze, I'm selling everything at 10x ($155). I don't believe that will happen. But if it does, I'm 100% doing it.

Bad thing is, this app only has a few hundred different stocks you can buy/sell. Good thing is, I can wait to withdraw this money in 2021, maybe even 2022, and pay my taxes for that year instead of this year. This is legal where I live, the tax man only cares about my bank account income statements for now. It could change in the future. I have microdick budget ($4.6k) and I didn't lie my way into Interactive Brokers or some other more reputable platform that want big dick $20k+ budget investors.  In your retard opinion, am I shooting myself in the foot too much for trying to postpone taxes eating away some of my current gains? In other words, is the downside of not having access to thousands of different stocks outweighing the upside of tax reporting flexibility?  For example, I couldn't do your STIC play, because there's no STIC in Revolut.   Thank you and [DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) for confirming my GME conviction btw.

I will tell you, as much as I'm consumed by all this myself, I am aware I don't know enough about most of the stuff that pertains to this GME play. I own shares too (231 shares bought at $15.4), I'm counting on a 2x, I consider 3x realistic and hoping for a 5x.  However, having absolutely no exit strategy is worse. So my advice to you is to take whatever you know and think, related to your 200 GME positions, evaluate all of that and then come up with an exit strategy.  For me personally, if the short squeeze gets squoze, I'm selling everything at 10x ($155). I don't believe that will happen. But if it does, I'm 100% doing it.

Most of you didn't care GME had a ticker a year ago, remember? Everyone knows it and this game is long. That's why Tesla shorts are so wildly confusing; They're just burning out due to capital weight but that's 60 to 2500 not 4 to maybe 50 or 60.   TL;DR: Melvin will be fine. You have no opponents.

Yes, but it\u2019s also just better rounded so you will always gain during booms in certain sectors. ARKG was having a hard month when ARKF was doing great, for instance. ARKK still stayed course.

It\u2019s the Nickel, specifically their giant supply of Nickel in Indonesia. The general speculation is that Tesla will give Vale a giant contract (they already buy most of their nickel from Vale). Based on various news coming out of Indonesia over the last month regarding labor laws/expat property ownership and cues from Tesla it seems as though it\u2019s getting very close.

For example, Costco stock gained 410 fold in 38 years since IPO, plus dividend.  It's P/E ratio was always above 30. Right now is 37. But Costco stock was always undervalued.  Some people will say Tesla P/E 1200 is too expensive, but it's actually undervalued.  Anyone who uses P/E to value a stock basically doesn't know how to value a stock.

I will tell you, as much as I'm consumed by all this myself, I am aware I don't know enough about most of the stuff that pertains to this GME play. I own shares too (231 shares bought at $15.4), I'm counting on a 2x, I consider 3x realistic and hoping for a 5x.  However, having absolutely no exit strategy is worse. So my advice to you is to take whatever you know and think, related to your 200 GME positions, evaluate all of that and then come up with an exit strategy.  For me personally, if the short squeeze gets squoze, I'm selling everything at 10x ($155). I don't believe that will happen. But if it does, I'm 100% doing it.
