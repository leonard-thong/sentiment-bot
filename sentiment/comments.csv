193,"Hm, I didn't even notice your options were sells before, that's smart. Buying options, obviously, is the quickest path back to your money, but selling much much safer.

It's boring not playing weeklies, but my recommendation, for a little bit of risk of course, is itm put selling a few months out. Obviously, some risk is inherent there, it's a pretty bullish stance on a stock that compared to buying calls will have less reward but less inherent risk, as you're gonna get shares instead of nothing if you're wrong. You can get about a third of your collateral for selling either 30p for rkt or 15p for plug for December. You can take that 8.5k in premium and sell more on that too, that's another 2 point something thousand.

I have no idea on timing things, but I do believe that rkt will be worth more than 30 and plug 15 someday. It might be in 2 weeks it might take a year. But ima be paid to buy those shares. If they both theoretically start completely flat by expiration, you can buy those contracts back with the extrinsic value stripped from it for small profit.

I personally have some 33p's for rkt for Oct and Dec, and I've been doing weekly and bi weekly put sells for plug. Been like 5-6 weeks and I'm finally getting assigned today 1000 shares of plug. I'll wait for green and start selling calls.

305,"Even $60bn is 5x the size of Etsy (during the best possible circumstances for Etsy) and this is an index that's supposed to be representing the largest companies.

BTW the auto industry is a 4 trillion dollar industry. If the government said gas cars are illegal next quarter and everyone has to drive EVs (like they just did for Etsy's sector) then TSLA's revenue would be off the charts.

I am the furthest thing from a tsla bull but at least there is a reasonable upside case to be made. They are far and away the industry leaders of an industry that could be a 4 trillion dollar industry in our lifetimes. Etsy is like a crappy version of the 20th best online retailer that did super modest revenue during a quarter where the government forced everyone to shop in their sector.",tsla

524,"Hey there. Im diagnosed with panic disorder. It's really really fucking hard. Therapy helps, meds can help. There's a book called ""bad ass ways to end anxiety and stop panic attacks"" that has some good content to get your brain thinking about it in a new light and not despairing all the time.

A panic attack is like getting thrown from the raft while white water rafting or getting hit by a big wave at the ocean. You can't fight it. You can't stop it. You have to buckle up for the ride and wait. Find things that help make it easier on you (mindfulness exercises, count backwards from 1000 by 3s, go for a walk, get a coloring book.) And weather the storm. Fighting it is like trying to swim against the tide; it will be more difficult and ultimately worse.

The best you can do is try to identify if you have triggers etc.

When I get that familiar feeling of lightning jolting through my body and my heart is beating out of my chest and I feel like i can't breathe and I almost always throw up, I try to remind myself that no matter what happens it will be OK. Literally the worst thing that could possibly happen is I die. And that's ok. The world keeps turning. 

The panic makes the panic worse, i know. It feeds itself and is self-fulfilling. I get panic attacks when I really dont want to. Like on a plane or standing in line at the store. Anytime I think ""man jt would really suck to have a panic attack here of all places,"" boom, triggered. 

I have a few mantras: ""whatever happens, its ok."" Note that its not ""im ok"" but ""its ok."" Because even if YOURE not ok, THAT'S ok. Its valid, and you're allowed. 

The other mantra I have is ""theres a difference between giving UP, and giving IN."" you have to give IN to panic attack, but never give UP.

I'm happy to talk more about panic attacks any time you'd like to talk. Just do me a favor and stay away from the panic attack/anxiety/DPDR subreddits. Everyone there means well and deals with a lot of the same stuff youre feeling, but it can also trap you in a bad cycle.

906,The hardest thing to do in options “trading” imo is to let your cash sit there and wait for opportunities. Making too many trades/FOMO has killed me a few times but it’s so hard to stop,imo
907,Lookin for a big Walmart pop this month. Would be surprised if they weren’t atleast $155 by end of month with $170-180 potential if they somehow buy tik tok AND report millions of subscribers with Walmart+,tok
908,I noticed they are doing a ton of publicity. Even paying for ads on Facebook. My gut tells me they are more focused on investors than actually making anything. I wonder when Muddy Waters will come around to investigating them 🧐,ads
909,If friday was any indication tsla is going to squeeze hard on a real green day man,tsla

911,"I had a successful streak where I just used cheddar flow and followed the activity on there, and I would buy shares at eod and sell at open for small profits almost everyday. That was when I first started trading options and I made a few grand doing it. But then I saw the retards on here making big money and got jealous and now I have blown my account up. So idk",eod
912,"obviously im just spouting more bs, but people thinking softbank news is catalyst for ""next leg down"", really?  did u just get here?

we had the same type of shit back in june when even worse shit was getting propped up and was ""popped"", going from 325 to near 295 before our current rally.  i didn't think shit like disney and MGM would recover but look at where we are, and those def had a fucking reason not to come back.

we are in a tech bubble or bubble in general for sure, but at least the shit getting propped up is doing well during covid lol.  i also would not expect the weak meme stocks to bounce back on fri if people were truly escaping.  you'd see shit like wayfair completely shit the bed.",def

Plus more buying from a market that never previously had AAPL shares.",aapl
915,Just imagine what would happen to tsla if they announced a tesla electric tank,tsla
